    "The dataset is a collection of 3911 argumentative essays of 8th-12th grade English Language Lerners. The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar and conventions. The scores range from 1.0-5.0 in increments of 0.5, higher is better. (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning/data)\n",

    " - phraseology = organizing words and phrases into longer elements\n",

       "3406  when people ask you for advice they sometimes talk to more people than one they ask they ask for a good advice becuase if they will not have good advice they can't think about a good decision somtimes a person who have trouble in her or his life or any depression our any happiness in thier life they can't make control thier a control on them. so they get pannic sometimes they can't think what to do they don't know how to do things so that's why they from many people but when they seeks multiple opinions so they get confiused they can't select one opinion that is good for them they want to think about that but they can't do that so they ask many people for different opinions so that's good but also not good tho but so they need to figure that what they should do or what not what i think is it's ok to ask people thier opinions but we should also need to think use our mind whithout our mind we can not do any thing the opinions that are given by other people we should think about them like what are they saying what's the point is it good for us or not or if i will follow this opinion it will make trouble for me or not then u will ask your friend or a person that is so close to you if that person will say yes you will be like ok than . lets do it!\\n\\nso you do a whole long procisior for getting a one good opinion what you need to do is that ask opinions from two or three people and then if u think it's not a good opinion than think your own and then take a good decission. everyone takes thier own decission i think if you wanna ask for a opinion find a good trustful adult who really really wants to help you who will give you a better choice and then think about it if you think that she or he is right then just follow the directions for example i have a birthday party and i need to select the dresses for everyone and arrange the birthday party and i don't have enough time i am so worried and confiused i don't known what to do .\\n\\ni need a help from people i asked from my friends, cousins ,family, teachers and then i think that i have a lot of opinions so i can't choose\\n\\n1 so what i did was i asked my older cousine and then we discused about that she told me in details what to do and then i managed my time and i choosed the dresses i arranged the birthday party in one week everything was so good that's how we make better chioce for our self if u can't do that at least think on your own or ask for help and ask from a good person not anyone you don't know well becuase people can play with you so we have to be carefull so i think asking an adult is more better than asking a lot of people becuase asking an adult will help you more becuase the first time i need help and i asked a lot of people and i was so confiused and i was like what is going on with me because it was my first excperience i didn't use my mind it was so bad waste of time every thing was ruined and that's why i learned something is never do anything that your parents or adult don't like here is another way to make a better choice and that is always listen to your parents and your adult because sometimes the decisions that you are making it seems like they are good but after some time you realize that it's not good for you u get in trouble and all you have face somethings so thats why do what your parents are telling you to do not what you wants to do it's ok to listen to your heart but sometimes it's not so the best way to make a better choice is listen your parents and adult\\n\\n2nd is use your mind to think that it's good or bad the 3rd way is to ask someone who is an adult and such a nice and truthfull person believe in your self and your god these are the best ways to make a better choice we should always believe in your self and your parents because they will always tell you a thing that is good for you no matter what it is just think that yuor parents tell you to do that and again believe in yourself if you will everything will be good if you be feel good belie...   \n",

He said you going to success god help us.\\n\\nYes i,m agree because every people fallow the role and going to toghader don,t loss enyone.British Prime Minister Winston Churchill so good idea,because people go just one satap success god help,s more help go up belive the god and yourslaf. Failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\\n\\nI,m agree with him. He has a good idea about the improtand role and that failure plays in the pursuit of success,because you have pawer fight with failure,and failure you won oneday success and you have prode yourslaf.He is a nice idea give you but fast all fasl the most improtand everywhere fallow the role,success consists of failure loss you enthusiasm.

My idea supported by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said,success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Pursuit of success i hope so the maen idea is success of help god but said him good idea give us all.\\n\\nOne day you have success fight the failure ever peolpe fast fight the failure than have a success. Eevry people dont have success because thay are not sarvie life no fallow the role,s and dont have good thinking go up.\\n\\nMr: British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said is very improtand idea and good thinking every people fallow the rules than you go up success you don,t have good think you not move go up success.\\n\\nMain idea is success and failure with fight than go about success.\\n\\nHe is very amizing idea and supptand the success and you know without failure not have not success. You frist down than go up going to success you not fight failure you not go up you not have success.\\n\\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill i,m agree with you.

       "      <td>I would like to start of this topic with a important question that no human being really thinks about, \"How is technology impacting our health?\" That is one of the most important questions that we can't leave unanswered.\\n\\nThe use of technology have rooted in our lives, from the moment we wake up till the moment we go to bed we have hundreds of interaction with various devices, software programs, and tools. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having any contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to any other person. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people's lives.\\n\\nWhile one might think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive effects on people's lives, others might think that the lack of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on people's lives which most people agree with.\\n\\nWhen comparing two human beings, one human being that always uses technology to do everything, shop, check out books, play games, do homework, and even talk to friends or family members, that person is most likely going to get sick, be in a lot of pain, or even feel depressed sooner then the person that prefers not to use technology at all but instead of using technology they would rather go out to the store to buy a book, go out to the store to shop new clothes, and even instead of calling on the phone to check on a family member they would rather go out and see them in real life. The reason the person that uses technology more is more likely to get sick or be in pain sooner than the other one is because not only computers and devices encourage more sedentary behavior among users but they also frequently lead to poor posture, neck stain, back issues, and hearing loss. This sort of behavior can lead to chronic pain and discomfort that is hard and not really easy to treat.\\n\\nNow that we have explained and understood this topic a little bit better let's go back to the question that we asked at the beginning, in case some of you guys forgot the question, the question was\\n\\n\"How is technology impacting our health?\" If people really took the time to think about this question that we usually always leave unanswered we would have known that technology isn't impacting our health in any positive way, technology actually makes us stressed, makes our eye vision bad, gives us back pain, hearing loss, and a lot of other negative outcomes. Another reason why people might feel depressed when they use technology a lot, is because they don't really interact with people and dont have any friends since all they do is stay at home and do everything on their device. It's scientifically proved that every human being need at least one or more friends to talk to every time they feel down and don't feel really good about something. That is the reason why most of the people that use technology a lot, sometimes feel depressed and don't really like to interact with other people around them.\\n\\nIn conclusion , technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a negative effect on people's life and if people don't learn how to control and manage their time and not use technology every chance they get, our next generation will be exactly the same as this one right now .The sad thing about the limitation of human contact due the use of technology is that there is no turning back at this point we are in a society where technological innovation and progression is the norm; It would take a minor miracle to reverse all this disaster.

       "      <td>The Curfews Keep Teenagers Out Of Trouble\\n\\nOnce, I walked down the empty street during midnight. Then, I heard a rising sound of a strange footstep behind me. Suddenly, I felt anxious and scared that someone might come up to me and murder me for money. Lucikly, there was nothing happened to me. After I got home, I had a thinking that what if a city council adopts a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is published, any teenager who is wandering on the street after those hours would be violating the law. On the other hand, some might believe that the curfews unfairly interfere in young people's lives because it does not let the teenagers have their freedom and accomplish something that is very important to them, which they cannot do it another time. I still agree with the idea that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it stops teenagers from doing something that is illegal during the late hours, it moderates them to be a better humans being with molarity without having any criminal records, and it prevents young people from being kidnapped or killed at night.\\n\\nSome people argue that curfews should not be publish because it limits the freedom of most teenagers. Still, I believe that curfews should be establish to put an end on any illegal act that is commited by teenagers because the young people should be controlled by laws when most of them are not mature enough. They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews aren't carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts. The estalishment of curfews is important because it shapes all teenagers to become the better people who has morality instead of threatening others to get what makes them feel pleasure.\\n\\nThe curfews should be carrried out to moderate all teenagers into better people who treats others in the right way because it helps them stay out of any trouble that might be an unfortunate consequense in their future. It shapes their morals and erases all their bad behaviors that makes others feel unpleasure. For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents' awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many ...</td>\n",

I still agree with the idea that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it stops teenagers from doing something that is illegal during the late hours, it moderates them to be a better humans being with molarity without having any criminal records, and it prevents young people from being kidnapped or killed at night.\\n\\nSome people argue that curfews should not be publish because it limits the freedom of most teenagers. Still, I believe that curfews should be establish to put an end on any illegal act that is commited by teenagers because the young people should be controlled by laws when most of them are not mature enough. They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews aren't carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts. The estalishment of curfews is important because it shapes all teenagers to become the better people who has morality instead of threatening others to get what makes them feel pleasure.\\n\\nThe curfews should be carrried out to moderate all teenagers into better people who treats others in the right way because it helps them stay out of any trouble that might be an unfortunate consequense in their future. It shapes their morals and erases all their bad behaviors that makes others feel unpleasure. For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents' awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many ...   \n",

Life is bassicly about learing new things every single day even though without experience because life is simple and we must live happy and around with the people we love. When a person thinks they know everything in life they dont do good because they trying to make the other person less then others you must be kind to those the dont have experience because you may not know some day you will go to a different country. When you dont know anyting because you not from their so you going to need help from others to explain you about the culture or how to eat a food because you have to no experience on the new country. You must help a person the has no experience because maybe you may need help from the person the you didnt want to help.\\n\\nyes, even thought you may not have experience in the type of job you seek,you can learn and teach others.\\n\\nIf you dont have experence in a restaurant for the job you seek for you will learn. For example a person the has no experence working in a restaurant,the only place they will offer you would be to be a diswasher. But you want to dream big because everytime a person has big dreams they can learn the job whereever, you want to be like a cooking person or a kitchen manager. In a job there is always going to be people the they dont want to see you in a better place because they may think you dont deserve to be there but you the only one the knows how hard you being working to achieve your dream .In life you always going to have proof without experience to see how good you are to learn a new job in the kitchen so if you can learn quick. They can give you a good place for you teach others the has no experience.\\n\\nMy dad has always talk with my cousins that when their is no experience you can always learn and fight for what you want.

But later on he learn how to speak then, he went to tryout for fc virginia he made it also everyone was talking about him because hes a great soccer player also, hes a great person. Then he came to the house and thanks my dad because of the edvice he gave to him the even though you dont have experience,you can always learn and fight for you goals. My dad is man the wants the best for hes family because when he was a kid he wanted to be a loyer but it was hard for hes parents because they were really poor and the corruption was really bad in the country.\\n\\nIn every job their is always going to be a person with no experience. For example people with no experience those are the ones the learn the job and when they learn the job very well they always try not to make a mistake because thay want to get the job done with quality.

       "      <td>Do you think students would benefit from being able attend classes from home?\\n\\nYes! its benefit for student who attend classes from home. Because some student want to attend classes from home because they thinks it's very important for them . And they think they can learned fast, and understand than they student who attend classes from school. For example my friend told me that she's attand classes from home it's good for her, because they is some subject she didn't understand when she attend classes from school but when she attend the home classes she good for that subject. she like science she think science its important for her but she didn't understand anything any science but she understand science because she attend classes from home. And some parent doesn't want they are children to attend classes from school, because many christian doesn't want they are children to attend to classes from school because they doesn't believe science and they want they are children to be disrespectful for teacher or for them. Maybe student can deciding to attend classes from home because it's benefit for them and it's good for the people who have lot of money. It's not any people who can attend classes from home.\\n\\nsome student attend classes from home because they hate bull or trouble. because they is student who come to school to bull other student or to fight with other. I know they is some people who scared about fight or bull by someone. For example the was a girl who attend very day to school and they was three girl they bull and beat her everyday and try to kill her self because she think she doesn't have anyone who can fight for her and when her parent sigh her want to kill herself, immediately they stop her, and they say they can not let they children to go back for school and they think every school it's like that school. so that why attand class from home it's good sometime. They are student who attend classes from home for the reason because to provide the experience and to show that they can try to learned themselves. In order to achieve anything at all in life a attend classes from home would must being take a deciding whether.</td>\n",

       "0  when a person has no experience on a job their is always going to be good people to help you and try to explane the job you need to get done in life you were not born with knowing everything. Life is bassicly about learing new things every single day even though without experience because life is simple and we must live happy and around with the people we love. When a person thinks they know everything in life they dont do good because they trying to make the other person less then others you must be kind to those the dont have experience because you may not know some day you will go to a different country. When you dont know anyting because you not from their so you going to need help from others to explain you about the culture or how to eat a food because you have to no experience on the new country. You must help a person the has no experience because maybe you may need help from the person the you didnt want to help.\\n\\nyes, even thought you may not have experience in the type of job you seek,you can learn and teach others.\\n\\nIf you dont have experence in a restaurant for the job you seek for you will learn. For example a person the has no experence working in a restaurant,the only place they will offer you would be to be a diswasher. But you want to dream big because everytime a person has big dreams they can learn the job whereever, you want to be like a cooking person or a kitchen manager. In a job there is always going to be people the they dont want to see you in a better place because they may think you dont deserve to be there but you the only one the knows how hard you being working to achieve your dream .In life you always going to have proof without experience to see how good you are to learn a new job in the kitchen so if you can learn quick. They can give you a good place for you teach others the has no experience.\\n\\nMy dad has always talk with my cousins that when their is no experience you can always learn and fight for what you want. When my cosuin came to America he wanted to play travel soccer, he went to tryout but the coach told him the has any experience of talking english so he wouldn't make it. But later on he learn how to speak then, he went to tryout for fc virginia he made it also everyone was talking about him because hes a great soccer player also, hes a great person. Then he came to the house and thanks my dad because of the edvice he gave to him the even though you dont have experience,you can always learn and fight for you goals. My dad is man the wants the best for hes family because when he was a kid he wanted to be a loyer but it was hard for hes parents because they were really poor and the corruption was really bad in the country.\\n\\nIn every job their is always going to be a person with no experience. For example people with no experience those are the ones the learn the job and when they learn the job very well they always try not to make a mistake because thay want to get the job done with quality.

They are student who attend classes from home for the reason because to provide the experience and to show that they can try to learned themselves. In order to achieve anything at all in life a attend classes from home would must being take a deciding whether.   "

      "3689 751 In some occasion you feel weary or oppress to think about that you have to take high school during 4-years when you know that you can do in 3-years? Some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in 3-years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in 3-years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early .\n",
      "\n",
      "The students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like Algebra 1, Geometry, Earth Science, History 1 ect, they can easely graduate and 3-years. I have two brothers older than I my brother that is 20-years-old he graduate in 3-years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in 3-years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also some school districts don't offer this program to graduate in 3-years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in 3 year,but the school districts don't have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is 29-years-old he only miss one class to graduate in 3-years but the school from California did not have the programs to leave him graduate in 3-years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students don't have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who don't have the help enough to pay their career. During this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The students who are a school don't have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. This is why a lot of students who graduate from high school don't take a career because they don't have the money to pay it, or their parents don't have money to help them, I have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you don't have the money enough to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases occur that when the student finish they high school in 3-years they start college one year early, or they start to work to make the money for it, they can finish their career more younger , we know that some career take like 6 or 8 years it will be so long , but have finish high school one year early will be so helpful for the students life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some students feel weary when they are taking 4-years of high school, they don't even have time to think about what they want to be, which career they want to take. The students don't have the time enough and this is why some students take wrong career and is very harmful for their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, all school districts should be allow to offer the programs that high school students can graduate in 3-years, some school districts want the traditional four years, they think that is so helpful for the students, but they are wrong because the traditional four years cause a graduate decrease and many students go to school just for one or two classes, in the future if all school districts approve the programs to students can graduate in 3-years. Many students will be taking their career in college some one starting one year early, and other making the money during the year off to pay their career.                     \n",

When you created the windows PC it revolutionized the world of technology, and ever since then I have been taking technology classes, programming classes, and even engineering classes so that one day I can created something of my own or even be a part of something surrounding your companies work. It would mean a lot if you gave me the chance to come visit your company and learn about the things your company does such as, what type of work your employees do throughout the week, the environment among and which your employees work in, and how you maintain your servers for your computers across the world I would also like to learn a little bit more of your journey as an entrepreneur in your early days, the sacrifices you had to make and the chances you took to get where you are today.\n",

I have researched everything about your company going back to the roots when you were in the garage building your computer and programming them to now being one of the richest men in the world having your employees build them for you. I aspire to become a great man like you and this the perfect opportunity to show you and everyone else what i am capable of. I believe that if you choose me as your intern you will gain an even greater advantage in the world of business and technology, I have a certain set of skills that allow me to learn things quick about human behavior and gain the advantage over competing companies i have studied the nature of consumers and i know exactly what they like to see and hear, having me learn a thing or two from you will give not only me a learning experience but you as well.\n",

You managed on your own to create something as big as your company with just an idea and some programs. Learning something from you is a once in a lifetime thing that probably never happens to most up and coming entrepreneurs like me. Giving me this chance not only helps me but it helps my family and my community. we live in a small town with not much technology and my dream is to change that I want the people in my town to experience the wonders of technology i want to show them that i learned everything I know from the man who started it all, the man who revolutionized the world.\n",

Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. Teachers and staff may feel stressed planing the trips but in the end i think they enjoy it just as much as the students.\n",

Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,'my work is more important.' We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes it's just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often.\n",

Everyday students asks to go outside. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. Students often look forward to the end of the day or field trips because it gives them air and a chance to breath. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places.\n",

We have been doing a lot of work every day and you know what for global warning, know let's talk about the people many peoples say can't change them self because is hard, it is impossible, no one will see change on my, and many other thing but peoples need to change their behavior, among the day peoples feels tired because they had bad day or they do many work. but i will never give up because as the tree can change the leaf to another color i can change the world one thing i can change myself but we can change it as a team with many other peoples, is better together than alone the change will even bigger and bring many others countries and join us, if i can change myself i can change another peoples to see the real life in what we live. I want to talk about me i really want to change myself because many other peoples needs me to help them be courteous, kind, responsible, on time and try to do better on what i do, change myself and the life of peoples it is my priority number one, if i know what is write and what is wrong i know what i gonna do change the impossible to possible nothing is this world is perfect nobody but we have to support other in what they need, we have to be happy of our self from the right thing we have been doing and up coming. I like technology and electricity those are the to matter i want to study with technology i would like to build a personal robot because everybody wants one and help in the day with the task of the home i know that will cause dangerous because can damage itself with an update or make it crazy but that can change the life yes everybody will be happy and peoples can rest better, with the electricity i would like to do the first smart phone that can charge with the sun because can not be generate a lot of energy. Is never too late you can make many thing as you can but if you make it you are right is not wrong make mistake i can tell you one thing is good because you can learn from them if you never make mistake you are wrong the mistake are the key to successful to change the bad thing to the right. You are my passion to live my mom say and you can change the world or may be not because in your head there is your world where you can build many thing to help peoples maybe you can not build a big change but one little thing is more bigger that i big thing, the change is coming very soon around the corner. but the change is not enough many peoples think the opposite and they never will change their minds that the bad thing are right and is very sad see peoples thinking about it they need to open their eyes and see what is really happening around their environment. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change this prompt is easy to understand because in the actuality there are many impressions that can never change of course others can do it but not a lot will be agree, sometimes i don't know what to write i write what i see, i heard, and touch my experiences to change are really small but the dreams come true sometimes not in the real life but in your head yes if i could dream a big dream to change world and the life for the peoples who need a little help to make their dreams come true and th...\n",

If your school extend school day for two hours there are some thing you can't do. You can't play after school games. You can't do your homework. You have less time to work. You going home late. You can't fresh your mind.\\n\\nReason one, students who work after school they have moer time on work. For example, if your working time is four o'clock to ten o'clock. If you work regular time you going to make more money. Students need to work becaus they needs to pay the cell phome bills or on gasolin.\\n\\nReason two, students who want to play after school game they can play the game. If they don't have time to play after school game they can't fresh there mind. For example, students who live one or two hours away for school they have time to play after school game.\\n\\nReason three, students can fresh there mind. Students can't fresh there mind because they are studying more then they need. For example, some time students can't remember what they learn in class, but can do other thinks. Some time student haveing so much fun in the class. Because there mind is so much fresh.\\n\\nThat why school can't extend the school day for two hours. Students can get tired in ten hours of study. Students can't fresh there mind. They can't play after school game. Students who work after school they have less time on work. That why school shouldn't extend the school day for two hours.\n",

Technology was not as big as it is today, but for some reason I have always shown interest in the products that your company has made. When you created the windows PC it revolutionized the world of technology, and ever since then I have been taking technology classes, programming classes, and even engineering classes so that one day I can created something of my own or even be a part of something surrounding your companies work. It would mean a lot if you gave me the chance to come visit your company and learn about the things your company does such as, what type of work your employees do throughout the week, the environment among and which your employees work in, and how you maintain your servers for your computers across the world I would also like to learn a little bit more of your journey as an entrepreneur in your early days, the sacrifices you had to make and the chances you took to get where you are today.\\n\\nI am the perfect candidate to be picked as an intern for your company because of the fact that i have dedicated my life to technology and even followed your footsteps. I know everything there is to know about computer science, programming, and engineering. Out of all the companies that deal with computers, yours is by far the best. I have researched everything about your company going back to the roots when you were in the garage building your computer and programming them to now being one of the richest men in the world having your employees build them for you. I aspire to become a great man like you and this the perfect opportunity to show you and everyone else what i am capable of. I believe that if you choose me as your intern you will gain an even greater advantage in the world of business and technology, I have a certain set of skills that allow me to learn things quick about human behavior and gain the advantage over competing companies i have studied the nature of consumers and i know exactly what they like to see and hear, having me learn a thing or two from you will give not only me a learning experience but you as well.\\n\\nGiving me the chance to see your company work in person is one of my life goals and it would be an honor to learn how you managed to become not only one of the richest men in the world but also learn what made you decide to take on a challenge such as technology giving that it was one of the hardest things to adapt to in your time. You managed on your own to create something as big as your company with just an idea and some programs. Learning something from you is a once in a lifetime thing that probably never happens to most up and coming entrepreneurs like me. Giving me this chance not only helps me but it helps my family and my community. we live in a small town with not much technology and my dream is to change that I want the people in my town to experience the wonders of technology i want to show them that i learned everything I know from the man who started it all, the man who revolutionized the world.\\n\\nIn conclusion, giving me the chance to see the work you have created will spark something new in this world of technology. I have followed your footsteps, i have dedicated my life to technology and engineering. However with this opportunity i will create something of my own for my home town so that all my family members and towns people can experience the joys of technology.</td>\n",

I agree with statement because having a positive attitude led to great success and great oppurtunity to do something that you would love, or admire.\\n\\nWith a positive attitude you could do more in life than a person with a bad attitude. For example, a person with a bad attitude trying to get a job as a model but gets mad over how the clothes looks on them or how the photos of them came out. Getting frustrated, or angry won't led to great success that would just make the sitution worser because modeling is a strict job and they have limited time . They can't deal with bad attitude, so you can't success with that job by being anoyed by something that you disagree on . With a positive attitude you could success with modeling because you don't have problems with nothing ,as least you had an oppurtunity to get the job.\\n\\nPositive attitude led to great success like going to college, getting a good paying job, being respect by others. No one like a disrespecful person by being disrespectful you can't success in life. It's going to be diffucult but as least try be kind to others. People with positive attitude won't have a diffuclt time becuasuse there always kind and respectful to others.\\n\\nI agree with statement positive attitude is the key to success in life.

Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. Teachers and staff may feel stressed planing the trips but in the end i think they enjoy it just as much as the students.\\n\\nMiddle school is a stressful time. Students have to complete lots of work that isnt needed. They also have packets of homework to complete and the packets are usually due the next day. Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,'my work is more important.' We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes it's just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often.\\n\\nSchools are not the most funnest place to be. Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty. Being in a building that's stuffy all day makes many people annoyed. Everyday students asks to go outside. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. Students often look forward to the end of the day or field trips because it gives them air and a chance to breath. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the most enjoyed activity in schools are field trips because it gives them a breather and it gives them the opportunity to explore. Students and teachers should not have to be in a place like prison. I think there should be more field trips not just two a year.</td>\n",

He finish high school early in three years, bring it to him advantages to be successfully life for get a job a early age, he also got offers for different colleges ,the Harvard University send to him a letter for being a youngest students to finishing the school early, the day , I remember exactly we were sitting on the table eating the breakfast, my brother was brought a letter in his hand and crying at the same time, we did not realize, the most grateful new getting a free scholarship to attend at Harvard University so my brother Generic_Name was in shock.

He talked to me a few details about the roll day at university, he says the University its not hard, to being at early student attending a university with just three years of finish high school. He, say the university feels other home with news experiences to discover it. This explain University with early graduation in school it's not a problem.\\n\\nThird, beneficial being a young student graduated from high school. For example my dear brother Generic_Name.

Some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in 3-years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in 3-years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early .\\n\\nThe students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like Algebra 1, Geometry, Earth Science, History 1 ect, they can easely graduate and 3-years. I have two brothers older than I my brother that is 20-years-old he graduate in 3-years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in 3-years.\\n\\nAlso some school districts don't offer this program to graduate in 3-years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in 3 year,but the school districts don't have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is 29-years-old he only miss one class to graduate in 3-years but the school from California did not have the programs to leave him graduate in 3-years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing.\\n\\nThe student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students don't have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who don't have the help enough to pay their career. During this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life.\\n\\nThe students who are a school don't have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. This is why a lot of students who graduate from high school don't take a career because they don't have the money to pay it, or their parents don't have money to help them, I have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you don't have the money enough to take it.\\n\\nIn some cases occur that when the student finish they high school in 3-years they start college one year early, or they start to work to make the money for it, they can finish their career more younger , we know that some career take like 6 or 8 years it will be so long , but have finish high school one year early will be so helpful for the students life.\\n\\nSome students feel weary when they are taking 4-years of high school, they don't even have time to think about what they want to be, which career they want to take. The students don't have the time enough and this is why some students take wrong career and is very harmful for their life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, all school districts should be allow to offer the programs that high school students can graduate in 3-years, some school districts want the traditional four years, they think that is so helpful for the students, but they are wrong because the traditional four years cause a graduate decrease and many students go to school just for one or two classes, in the future if all school districts approve the programs to students can graduate in 3-years. Many students will be taking their career in college some one starting one year early, and other making the money during the year off to pay their career.</td>\n",

Technology was not as big as it is today, but for some reason I have always shown interest in the products that your company has made. When you created the windows PC it revolutionized the world of technology, and ever since then I have been taking technology classes, programming classes, and even engineering classes so that one day I can created something of my own or even be a part of something surrounding your companies work. It would mean a lot if you gave me the chance to come visit your company and learn about the things your company does such as, what type of work your employees do throughout the week, the environment among and which your employees work in, and how you maintain your servers for your computers across the world I would also like to learn a little bit more of your journey as an entrepreneur in your early days, the sacrifices you had to make and the chances you took to get where you are today.\\n\\nI am the perfect candidate to be picked as an intern for your company because of the fact that i have dedicated my life to technology and even followed your footsteps. I know everything there is to know about computer science, programming, and engineering. Out of all the companies that deal with computers, yours is by far the best. I have researched everything about your company going back to the roots when you were in the garage building your computer and programming them to now being one of the richest men in the world having your employees build them for you. I aspire to become a great man like you and this the perfect opportunity to show you and everyone else what i am capable of. I believe that if you choose me as your intern you will gain an even greater advantage in the world of business and technology, I have a certain set of skills that allow me to learn things quick about human behavior and gain the advantage over competing companies i have studied the nature of consumers and i know exactly what they like to see and hear, having me learn a thing or two from you will give not only me a learning experience but you as well.\\n\\nGiving me the chance to see your company work in person is one of my life goals and it would be an honor to learn how you managed to become not only one of the richest men in the world but also learn what made you decide to take on a challenge such as technology giving that it was one of the hardest things to adapt to in your time. You managed on your own to create something as big as your company with just an idea and some programs. Learning something from you is a once in a lifetime thing that probably never happens to most up and coming entrepreneurs like me. Giving me this chance not only helps me but it helps my family and my community. we live in a small town with not much technology and my dream is to change that I want the people in my town to experience the wonders of technology i want to show them that i learned everything I know from the man who started it all, the man who revolutionized the world.\\n\\nIn conclusion, giving me the chance to see the work you have created will spark something new in this world of technology. I have followed your footsteps, i have dedicated my life to technology and engineering. However with this opportunity i will create something of my own for my home town so that all my family members and towns people can experience the joys of technology.                \n",

I agree with statement because having a positive attitude led to great success and great oppurtunity to do something that you would love, or admire.\\n\\nWith a positive attitude you could do more in life than a person with a bad attitude. For example, a person with a bad attitude trying to get a job as a model but gets mad over how the clothes looks on them or how the photos of them came out. Getting frustrated, or angry won't led to great success that would just make the sitution worser because modeling is a strict job and they have limited time . They can't deal with bad attitude, so you can't success with that job by being anoyed by something that you disagree on . With a positive attitude you could success with modeling because you don't have problems with nothing ,as least you had an oppurtunity to get the job.\\n\\nPositive attitude led to great success like going to college, getting a good paying job, being respect by others. No one like a disrespecful person by being disrespectful you can't success in life. It's going to be diffucult but as least try be kind to others. People with positive attitude won't have a diffuclt time becuasuse there always kind and respectful to others.\\n\\nI agree with statement positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, if i was a hiring someone to work as a model and there two persons try to get the job but i need only one person i would see who haves a positive attitude i woundn't pick someone that don't have respect for others.           \n",

Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. Teachers and staff may feel stressed planing the trips but in the end i think they enjoy it just as much as the students.\\n\\nMiddle school is a stressful time. Students have to complete lots of work that isnt needed. They also have packets of homework to complete and the packets are usually due the next day. Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,'my work is more important.' We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes it's just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often.\\n\\nSchools are not the most funnest place to be. Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty. Being in a building that's stuffy all day makes many people annoyed. Everyday students asks to go outside. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. Students often look forward to the end of the day or field trips because it gives them air and a chance to breath. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the most enjoyed activity in schools are field trips because it gives them a breather and it gives them the opportunity to explore. Students and teachers should not have to be in a place like prison. I think there should be more field trips not just two a year.             \n",

Some students say, early graduation bring a successfully life in the future. High school students are graduating in three years because open more opportunity of life ,knowing the new world of college works,beneficial being a young student .\\n\\nfirst,\\n\\nopen more opportunity. for example the journal life of my older brother Generic_Name it is easy. He finish high school early in three years, bring it to him advantages to be successfully life for get a job a early age, he also got offers for different colleges ,the Harvard University send to him a letter for being a youngest students to finishing the school early, the day , I remember exactly we were sitting on the table eating the breakfast, my brother was brought a letter in his hand and crying at the same time, we did not realize, the most grateful new getting a free scholarship to attend at Harvard University so my brother Generic_Name was in shock. This explain getting early high school diploma bring a lot of opportunities.\\n\\nsecond, knowing the new world of college. for example. Generic_Name my oldest brother is attending the most prestigious university of the world Harvard university. He talked to me a few details about the roll day at university, he says the University its not hard, to being at early student attending a university with just three years of finish high school. He, say the university feels other home with news experiences to discover it. This explain University with early graduation in school it's not a problem.\\n\\nThird, beneficial being a young student graduated from high school. For example my dear brother Generic_Name. I'm super proud of him to taking major responsibilities in young age, he just took three years of high school and get done it. he called to my mom the day, when he notice the program to graduated early in school , my beautiful mom told him that is a good way to set up early his future and would be able to star a enrollment in university. The university believe students must be a genious to finishing high school early, University offer extra credits for being a young student. This explain young students graduated early are considered as smart person.\\n\\nThree years of high school to achieve it the most dreaming diploma.\\n\\nHigh school in three years, people belief students enough mature or full of knoledge to throught a real life but Graduating in three years of high school brought us brilliants benefits for the future.\\n\\nNew generation would be involved a system, where students finish their high school early to get good opportunitties in their lifes.                           \n",
       "3689  In some occasion you feel weary or oppress to think about that you have to take high school during 4-years when you know that you can do in 3-years? Some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in 3-years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in 3-years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early .\\n\\nThe students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like Algebra 1, Geometry, Earth Science, History 1 ect, they can easely graduate and 3-years. I have two brothers older than I my brother that is 20-years-old he graduate in 3-years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in 3-years.\\n\\nAlso some school districts don't offer this program to graduate in 3-years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in 3 year,but the school districts don't have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is 29-years-old he only miss one class to graduate in 3-years but the school from California did not have the programs to leave him graduate in 3-years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing.\\n\\nThe student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students don't have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who don't have the help enough to pay their career. During this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life.\\n\\nThe students who are a school don't have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. This is why a lot of students who graduate from high school don't take a career because they don't have the money to pay it, or their parents don't have money to help them, I have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you don't have the money enough to take it.\\n\\nIn some cases occur that when the student finish they high school in 3-years they start college one year early, or they start to work to make the money for it, they can finish their career more younger , we know that some career take like 6 or 8 years it will be so long , but have finish high school one year early will be so helpful for the students life.\\n\\nSome students feel weary when they are taking 4-years of high school, they don't even have time to think about what they want to be, which career they want to take. The students don't have the time enough and this is why some students take wrong career and is very harmful for their life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, all school districts should be allow to offer the programs that high school students can graduate in 3-years, some school districts want the traditional four years, they think that is so helpful for the students, but they are wrong because the traditional four years cause a graduate decrease and many students go to school just for one or two classes, in the future if all school districts approve the programs to students can graduate in 3-years. Many students will be taking their career in college some one starting one year early, and other making the money during the year off to pay their career.                        \n",

First, whan you try a now things you are going to have different naleg about a laset of different thing . Sconed , whan you have different ideas you have different way of thinking. Thired , whan you try to see other people and how they act and thiar coolter you will now how to talk with thim without disrspact thim . Lastly, that why we sholed alwase laren.\\n\\nWhan I try a now things i alwas laren some thing now .\\n\\nFor exampe, whaen i came to the U.S i did not have enafe naleg about what is in the U.S so that was a issue ror me learening the language i shragl becuase did not go beyond what i have already mastred. Than ,whan i staret to learen more about the language i start to go beyond my noleg. Allthuo life is hared and learening is hared but som times whan you learen a lote you get a lote .\\n\\nwhan you have different ideas you have different way of thinking. First , people wode love to talk to you and now you. Sconed, whan you in school you will have a lots of ideas about what class to take . Thired, Knowing a lot healp your famliy tow . finely that why haveing a lot of ideas healp you.\\n\\nWhan you try to see how other people and how they act and how thiar coolter is you now how to talk with thim othout disrspact thim. first, whan you you lisone to people and how the talk you going to larn e what cined of pirson he is and how to talk with thim . Sconed , you can choos the prson that you are going to love from larning about how the siseaty work . Third, bieing nice to every one mens you are goning out and seeing other people . and, that whay i agreed with the auther Ralph Waldo Emerson becuase going beyond what you have already mastered is laring .\n",

       "3652    Is a positive attitude key to success? Well, In my opinion I strongly agree, I believe a positive attitude will take you far in life and will let you accomplish many goals you've set for yourself. For instance having a positive attitude doesnt just affect you but it also affects others in a negative or positive way, for example motivation; you could motivate someone and inspire them just by doing you and accomplishing youre goals or you could even brighten somebodies day up by doing small gestures. In the other hand there will be people that dont want too see you do good, people that want to bring you down and people that have envy over you. That shouldn't bring you down that should be more motivation to do better because those are people who are jealous, people that are jealous of something you have and that they dont have. There are people who have started from the bottom with very little and are now doing big things, by having a positive mind set and believing in themselves. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people.\\n\\nIn my experience a positive attitude is a key to success, why? Well, when I was younger I had a difficult time with the English language because I only spoke Spanish at the time, which then resulted that I had to repeat a grade. Being left behind made me feel dumb and stupid, I also felt embarrassed; embarrassed of saying my age to the other kids when they would ask how old I was, I thought they would make fun of me and call me names. Through out the years I got more mature and I didnt really care no more about my age, I then found out that there were other kids that were in the same situation as me, which made me feel better about myself after.\\n\\nWhen I got to high school I met my case manager, he was and still is a really nice guy and really cares about the students. When I met him he asked me many questions one of them was how old I was when I told him he was surprised because I was older then the other students. He then asked why I was 16 years old with freshmen classes, I told him why and he understood. A few days pasted by and he asked me how I felt being behind the sophomore class, I told him I didnt like it and how I felt a little dumb. He then told me how I would feel about graduating with that class, I then knew what he was about to tell me and I liked the idea of it. He told me I could do three years but I would have to do two years in one, I didnt care if it would be more work all I was thinking of was graduating on time. So, of course I accepted and now I am here taking my writing SOL with my positive attitude! If I didnt have a positive attitude I wouldnt be here right now, and for sure I wouldnt be graduating in May of 2020. Im very happy and thankful that I have this opportunity, and I know I will make it through this school year if I believe in my self.\\n\\nThe other night I was going through my Facebook feed and I stumbled upon a link that one of my friends re-post, on that link there was an article of a women that is from El Salvador, and that women use to live near to where we used to live. On that article it said \"First women Pilot from El Salvador\" when I first read it I could not believe what I was reading, I was very happy for her and I know she worked so hard to get to where she's at. It is incredible knowing a women from a country that does not have much to give is now flying in the air going around the world. Reading that article motivated me to set goals for my self and to keep on going, if she can accomplish her dream I can to.\\n\\nI admire my mother, she's gone through so much and has risked her life to have a better one, not just for her but also for her family that she had to leave behind. Before she came to the United States her mother didn't want her to come she thought it was to much of a risk. My mom knew what she was getting her self into she believed everything would come out fin...\n",

      "\n",
      "I have heard of the school cafeteria's plan to change to a new healthier school lunch. And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. I believe that keeping our school's lunch menu is a good idea. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "My initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "they are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. American's have this quote that \" if you have lemons make lemonades\" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, our school cafeteria's lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the school's improvement is your priority.\n",

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If there's something you want but it's expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If there's someone you don't like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies. When someone did something wrong and lied about it. Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that it's reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasn't sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. For instant, if someone gets confuse. If you're lost on one subject. Also, if someone gets lonely. if someone doesn't have a baseball team. Lastly, if someone gets worried or afraid. If someone you know is absent or gone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices. I believe that asking yourself for advice is also necessary. but, viewing many opinions from people is probably more necessary than viewing your own advice.\n",

      "\n",
      "As humans we tend to try to fit in society; we like to feel liked by the people around us, so we act different than we actually are. The feeling of being liked by society in most cases makes us feel pride and self confidence, which is fine but makes a line between being our self and being influenced. Fitting in a society might be hard for some people,even frustrating, but people still are willing to do it so we can not be seen as different. trying to fit in a society might be the biggest reason why we do not act as we want and tend to act as everyone else in front of other people,because we fear that if society categorize us different then society is going to dislike us,however, there is some people that are careless of what people say about them. There is always someone that will not care at all of what people say about them which is good,but, there is always a time where they cared or will care about it. It is part of being a human that we care about what society says because we do not want be seen as someone different that can not fit. For example, students in schools dress as the trend is, so they can fit in society,even when they grow they will care how they look.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fear of making mistakes influences part of our character. We fear that making mistakes will make us imperfect or not good at something, therefore, we think that if we are not perfect we are a failure,the fear of making mistakes is what makes us human, and that is a gigantic influence to us and we can not control it but makes people stronger and, help us to develop a character that will represent us in the future. we fear many different things in life for example,our appearance, if we think our appearance is not as we want, we get insecure in many different ways but, it is a huge help in the development of our own character because we learn from those mistakes. Being insecure is a huge obstacle and mistake for people to get to choose their own character, because it does not let us decide for what we really want,therefore people should learn from them which it will hopefully help people to develop a better character. Many people find themselves as insecure because of the fact that people might dislike them. Scientist have said that having the fear of making mistakes will make it harder for people to achieve their most wanted goals in life. We all as humans make mistakes, therefore we can not or it is harder for us to find our own character by our own self.\n",
      "\n",
      "As humans we all have at least someone that we admire a lot,and we see them as a person we should imitate so we can be even a bit as them. Imitating someone in any way will make our self to struggle when trying to develop our own character because we are thinking of how someone else would think. Imitating someone else that has had such a great impact in life might be good for your self and you might achieve your goal because that person did. Even though our character is formed by influences of other we admire we also have to have our own character into it, so we can feel the pride of achieving a goal that has had our effort in to it. Having a bit of your own character into what you do is important too because it is not a full imitation of what someone else did. Many famous es have said that they also had followed someone else's steps to get where they are, so being influenced by the people you admire might help the people a lot to achieve their goals as it did with the famous people,and they also said that the people they admired a lot was the one helped them to find themselves, because if it was not for them they would have probably the same as they were before being famous.\n",

People are going to find themselves mostly from experiences and influences that they can not control,however you should have some of your own character to do things so when you achieve something important you feel better about yourself, but we,the people tend to act different so people like us and it is something inevitable,either control in life. As humans we dont like to be categorized as different and our main goal in a big percentage of people in the world is to fit in society and that is something that can not be controlled, but it helps us a lot to find our self afterwards and form our character at the end.\n",

Some people believed that you always have to try something new everyday, while other believed that they always want to work in something that they always flourished in. Although, doing what they know can make people feel confident but, its salient for us to flourish in our life, because you can learn new things to be successful, you can have more experience, you can also mastered in more things than you are in right now for more opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, trying new things can help you to be successful, sometimes you inserted that into your mind that you have never done that thing then,you end up saying that you can't do that, but never ever make that egregious decision in you life unless you never try you never going to know. For Example, a friend of mine named Generic_Name, once said that \"Try Try but don't Cry\" it means that don't ever think that you can't do it, you can and you can do it in better way than anyone else don't ever break your confident because of you nervous or for any other reason, but that's not how it works, you just need to fight through whatever reason you had. A myriad of people thinks that when they don't know what to do they always give up instead of trying, but its salient for all of us to put that confident into your mind. Also sometimes it can erroneous your feeling when nobody going to gives work to you because you never have done that work and also you refused to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, it is important for you to have more experience of everything than you have in order to flourish. Experience can make such a difference in what you have learn because it can prepares you from the beginning, so then you can't struggle any more in future, it can be harder at the beginning for some people, but it will get way more easier as you work through it in future. For Example, a student at Generic_school named Generic_Name had said that \"if I take classes that related to my career in high school it can make myself to be prepare for career in future.\" It means that he can have a myriad of experience in high school since, he is a flourishing student, also he can learn and experience things very quickly, so then its easy for him when he'll going to enter into his own career field. He'll not going to have that much trouble of being in that field like now a days other people have, and also He'll not going to be full of experience when he will go their or how it works, but he can learn basic things that he suppose to have in order to be in that career field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, you can mastered more than you are right now. If you mastered more their are more opportunity for you to get more scholarships. Scholarships can help you to graduated from high school with more credits and their are more chances for you to get accepted in collages. you can get to the collage that you really want to go into. There are myriad of collages that want you to be more intelligent and have mastered in everything because that's what they stand for since, it higher level of education they need, so its hard if you don't mastered more its not always like how you think that that's going happened sometime collages look for some staff that you never good at, so its important for all of us always be active. Its not fun to mastered more but sometimes you just have to make fun by working hard and putting you best effort into that work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Conclusion, it is salient to all of us to be good and stay active in everything that we can, because you never know when that all stuff that you have experience on can help you so we just need to be prepare it can flourish your future life. Its better for you to try flourishing from beginning of everything you have to have little bit of experience about everything it can also open up your future door to get success. For instants job, career and many other things that can help you to grow you experience that's the reason why we have to know or learn everything that is important it can help you to get into a career that can change your life.\n",

      "By the time students enter high school, I believe that they should have an idea of what type of career they would like to pursue after they graduate. For some students, committing to a specific career at young age sometimes is a good idea as long as you have a backup idea for a different career in case you decide that you do not want to pursue in that career anymore, thats why committing to a career at a young age is only sometimes a good idea because you'll never come up with another career if you keep changing your mind. The courses that you study in high school should be thought about as well because maybe you need a specific degree from a course in order to pursue in that career.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that, if a student is going to commit to a career that they should be very passionate about this career, they should be at least a junior in high school so that they've had time to get a feel of the other careers and decide which one they enjoy and suits them the best, and they should keep in mind the requirements that are needed, the benefits, and the types of jobs that it offers to them.

Therefore, you need to go to college, and work hard so you can get a good job because most jobs, don't hire anyone without a college degree.\n",

      "It better working as a groups because the teacher will think that we will benefit more thing as a project or classwork. And also that we will work together and talk as a groups for the teacher because working alone is hard to think for the one question that you don't know what is about. So many of students think working as a groups is better will help each other However, teacher will thinks many from us that will improve from talking each other and together. Because the student will do more stuff and talk a lot also as a groups and alone because many student will do that to get focus and pay attention the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "This why that people prefer working with a group is better. Because the reason that we want working as a group is that we will work together and help out the question to talk and give a convince from the work. That we will don't know the answer from the question or the problem because for example, well you think that as a sport you need to be in a group that play together, talk together, and work together as a team is the same thing in the school or other place. For the other example, you saw the cartoon of luney toons that bugs bunny and the duck doing the play for the opera that people will laugh this is call working together as a team to do funny thing in the cartoon shows.\n",

A lots of student and teacher think it will go better that working as a group well it going to be hard that whatever, that i need help or my friend need help we can not work together we only going ask the teacher for help for the question. Because many of student will do more better job in the class to do work and think more stuff outside the place. For example, some singer that work alone because the there want to be alone that make a better song and to do something and plan yourself to leave anywhere you want to see a better life alone.\n",

      "In conclusion some people like working with a groups and other half like working alone because the teacher said if you want work with a group go ahead if not you can work alone. So a lot of student show the teacher you can do both as a same time because it doesn't matter if want work as a group or alone because there will give you plenty of time that to do same thing as a group and alone. \n",

      "The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you're doing. Because you're defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life and you do what you think is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says \"Those who know God should love others, because God is love.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Not being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says \" Honor your father and mother.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays it's really hard to become yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. \n",

      "Many people are kind and do parts in helping others , what they don't know is , the act of kindness either received from or given to someone has a big impact no matter how small or big . Reasons an act of kindness can really benefit someone are , the person might have a better day just because of your kindness , the person might learn from your act of kindness and lastly , a good act of kindness can come back to you from the person who you helped .\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason of how kindness can impact a person is , the person whom you helped might have had a bad day or , you never know what someone is going through , they could have a hard life and are hiding it . The person who received the act of kindness might have bad a bad day or life , your kindness could have made that person feel so much better and worthy. Some people don't often receive kindness , you might have put a big smile on their face or , made their day much better . You can be seen as a person with good characters and manners , people can always depend on you if you are a kind person and do a lot to help make someone feel better with words or actions everyday , most people would appreciate you if you did almost anything to help them or make them smile because again , you never know what someone is going through . For example , I partnered up with a girl in our math class , she was crying for some reason and nobody wanted to be her partner , when I told her if she can be my partner , she said yes and sounded really happy when I said . I , of course told her what was wrong , she told me she was going through a lot at home and nobody wanted to be her friend in school , I was devastated to hear that . I told her she can be my friend and for the rest of the day she smiled and laughed .\n",
      "\n",
      "The second reason any act of kindness , big or small , can impact a person is , the person receiving the kindness can learn from you and make themselves a better character too , you can influence a person with how you act , if you act kind and generous and , make good choices , someone is gonna learn from your words and actions . Same with if your a person who is just rude and makes bad decisions , someone else , will learn from your actions . Many people tend to learn from people in their environment , especially young people , so if a young person sees you offering a kind act of helping to either them or someone else , they can learn from your actions and see you as a big role model , people should always make good decisions for many reasons one being that young people can benefit from your choices and will always look up to you for being the person to guide them through life , many people make bad decisions around children but if you do an act of kindness , to them or someone else , young kids will automatically learn from you . For example , one day me and my little sister were in the park , playing with our friends , we saw an old lady all of a sudden drop her apples , I immediately went to the side walk and helped the lady , I picked up the apples and put them in a safe and clean bag . The old lady thanked me and told me , \"you're well mannered , thank you for your help , I appreciate it , may god bless you\" , I smiled and said \"your very welcome\" . The next day as I was going to the bus stop , to pick my little sister up from school , my little sister ran to me and said \"I sat next to this new girl in our school who was being bullied . I even shared my lunch with her because, she did not have much food at home to bring to school \" . I was delighted to hear her story , I told her why she did that , she responded \"when I saw you helping the old lady yesterday , I realized how nice you were and how happy the lady was , I decided to do something similar \" .\n",
      "\n",
      "The third reason of how an act of kindness can benefit someone in many ways is , the good act of kindness can come back to you . For example , one day , a girl in our class came late to school , we were in our social studies class , she came and sat down and asked people if she could copy the notes , all of my classmates shouted \"NO\" .\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up to her and gave her my notes . She was happy and said thank you , when she finished copying my notes , I went to my seat . About a week later , we were having a contest in our school , whoever won would receive a prize . I sadly did not have any knowledge of the topic for the contest . The next day , I partnered up with the girl who copied my notes , I told her about how I wanted to win the contest . She looked happy and told me she knew all about the topic , she said she could help me and I replied with , \"I would appreciate it so much \" . I went to her house after school and taught me all about the animal , we needed to have certain knowledge of the animal to do the contest in our school . The next day , I did the project and the next day ,I winned .I thanked the girl .\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion , any act of kindness can benefit a person , you might make them smile , make them learn , or , the act will come back to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

      "I've been asked if is more beneficial working in a group with students or working alone. In my opinion I think working as a group is more beneficial than doing all the work alone. I think working as a group is less stress on the student but helps get the work done faster and easier. I've noticed that people do better in group projects because the work can be split between the students and not just one person doing all the work that may be hard to understand or do all the work on time. Working as a groups helps mostly those students who really don't do their work on time or having problems in understanding what to do and also they can ask the students in the group for more support or in explaining something more clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if a student that is working alone doesn't understand the concept of the project and has no one to ask or just doesn't want to ask the teacher they will either do it wrong or just not do it because they don't have that extra support. In a group you usually have that person that is on top of you if you are doing you part and asking if you need help or need more explaination. Being a group creates communication skill and helps those who have trouble with interacting with other students. Working as a group get the work done faster and helps not go to hard on youself. This is why when a teacher asks me if I want to work alone or with a group or partner, I always work with someone else becasue it just helps me get my assighnment done on time because I have done big projects by myself and I see that I struggle do it , then at the end I get a bad grade or I just end up not doing it because I feel like I can ask th teacher for help. Some students have this problem in reaching out to their teacher because they are either shy or they just can't find a way to get their help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many students will agree that working as a group is helpful and beneficial instead of working alone where is hard to do everything alone and having to plan what to do to get an assignment done and hoping for the best. \n",

That is if you start to fail classes, your parents ask the school to take you out of some, or if your attendance towards the meetings look bad. Then that is when the school helps decides what happens towards the student.\n",

      "First of all, I think it should be a certain extent in what you can enroll for but it should always be up to the student and their families since that is a major factor inn deciding what to do.

If the family decides on letting the child continue is upon them but if they chose to take their child out of the extracurricular activities the must notify the child's guidance counselor and notify the main person in the activity\n",

      "However, if the students starts to fail classes or most of your grades keeps dropping the the students guidance counselor should talk to the student and see why. If they see to many extracurricular activities then there should be a talk with the student to see which ones he can drop for the time until the grades are up. This should encourage the student that if they want to be a part of the activities the they have to be able to maintain their grades.\n",

      "People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. That's why I believe that people should always try to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but it's always good to take advice from experts. It's always good to talk to someone in case of an emergency. For example I was sick at home with a lot of pain and I refused to go to the hospital, until I talked to a doctor about how I was feeling and he suggested that I go to the hospital to get checked up and I did and it made me feel a lot better. Sometimes it's good to take an experts advice in a matter like I was in, you don't always have to take their advice but its good to just talk to someone about it and keep in mind what they say for future references. It's always good to follow your own instincts but sometimes it's not. Their are people who have experienced the same thing you might be going through right now and are certified or trained to help. For example my aunt is currently training to be a consular for high school kids and her goal is to gain the trust of her students so they can come to her when they need help. She always tells me that she was a high school kid at a point and she knows what its like and the problems kids might be going through, so that's why shes training to help them in making the right decisions. When I need help making a life decision about something like college I go to my consular who's been in college and knows what could be right for me, I always take in mind what they advice me and make a decision. It doesn't always necessarily need to be help for an adult it can always be help from a sibling or other family member who has been through what you have and who you know will lead you in the right direction. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but it's always good to take advice from experts. \n",

They will not be having test and quizzes often. They might become lazy and start copying each other work. If they do not attend school, then there will be less chances of students doing work sincerely at home. They will not be able to get proper education at home and there will be less communication with students and teachers. If there will be less communication then they will not be able to get more open with others. There will be no group work so that students can share their ideas regarding studies. They might start taking breaks often. There will be no routine for students for studying at home. They will not be able to concentrate much working at home due to lot of distractions like T.V, movies, videos games, text ting etc. If you will not get a better education you might not be able to sussed in life. The more you have the education then there are more chances of getting a bright future. The proper education you can get is by going to school. If you will attend school, then you can correct your mistakes and learn from them. If you will stay at home you won't know what are you doing correct and what you are doing wrong.\n",

If you make goals in your life, and you want to accomplish all your goals you will need to start by having a positive attitude, for example you see a car that you really like, and you say it to your self I want the car or my goal is to one day be able to buy the car.

      "Have you had a friend sharing wisdom and experiences with you? You probably had that a million times. Here is the thing though. People just want to learn the experience of you and the others, which isn't a bad thing. It's also important to learn each other's experiences. I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. To clarify this, let's dig in deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I think it's important that you understand who they are because you get to know about their favorite hobbies, the places they like to visit, the pets they have and their dream vacation. Getting to know on who the person is can give you a good start off to make a bond, or form friendship between you and that person. If you shared your experiences with a person, they might feel interested on what you're talking about. Telling a person on what you like can bring that person's attention deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it's important that you help the person if they're in a situation because you can cheer them up if they lost a family member. Helping someone out can make that person feel better and most of all, feel comfortable, and they will think that you're a good person. If you didn't reach out and help somebody, they could start getting into a tougher situation where they might not be able to handle by themselves. They could also feel very lonely or left out, and that is not okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, communicating with others is important because you can text them in Social Media, such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. You can also go shopping with them. Communicating others bring closer friendship, and keep the bond strong between you and you're friend. Watching movies and hanging out at each others house are another examples of communication. They're lots of ways to communicate with your friends and other people, and that is a good thing for friends. Activities is another thing for communicating with other people because sometimes, when people do activities, it provides teamwork.\n",

      "In Conclusion,\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it is important to learn from other people's experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they're in a situation, and you can communicate each other. So now that you understand, think about these as you make new friends. Question yourself on how to get a good start to form a bond between you and that person. Try to reach out and help him/her if they need help with something. Make that person feel comfortable by hanging out with them at lunch or at home. They might need good company from you!      \n",

      "The great question here is, should schools allow students to use cell phones for educational purposes or should cell phones be prohibited in the classroom? In my opinion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some school staff members may claim that cell phones should be forbidden in the classroom even for eductional purposes. Because, they think students will lose their attentions. However, I firmly believe that shools should allow students to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students will be effective academically as long as they use cell phones in the classroom. There are several reasons for my opinion. My first reason is that as a student, whenever I use cell phones in the classroom, I can search things easily and take pictures when nedded if my teachers allow me; which will help me on my studying when I go home. Another reason for my opinion is, if I don't have my phone with me, I will be eager until the bell rings and get my phone back without concentrating on the class. For example, I have a friend whose father took her cell phone forcing here to study the whole school year. Stubbornly, she stops doing what he tells her to do. Instead, she persistently hang-out and have more fun. As a result, she got F's for all of her classes. Therefore, using cell phones in the classroom helps the learning-teaching process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using cell phones in the classroom helps to call if something happens in the class. For instance, if a stranger comes with a gun or if a lock-down happens and I hear the stranger's voice, I will call 911 for help. Secondly, if an emergency occurs like fire, hurricane, and a huge lightneing while I am in the class, I may need to call to my family to let them know how I am doing. In that case, they will know about my situation. To sum up, most people like doing things which are forbidden for them. Students may hide and use their phones for another purpose eventhough they are not allowed to use it in the classroom; which is more riskier than using in front of the teachers. Consequently, the positive effect of using cell phones in the classroom is more influential.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Other people say that cell phones should not be used in schools during class periods. I obstinately argue that phones should be used in the classroom for the purpose of education since the positive effect is more influential and using cell phones is more quicker than using laptops or other electronic devices.\n",

Well get respect from the others people with your personality can be healthfull because when you are good leader the workers respect you and they work more and if you still confesed well let me ask you if you work with boss the is always angry and he is always yell you will be confortable to work ( I don't belive) or your boss is always making jokes you know to be \"cool\" you will respect him (I don't believe).\n",

      "Whether the limitation of human contact due to technology has had a positive or negative effect on people's lives, is a constant topic of discussion. Technology is an amazing tool, with countless positive effects. It has made society what it is today. Without it people would not know life the way that it is now. Technology makes many activities in life possible, which before would have been impossible. The first man to walk the moon did it by the means of technology. The vehicles which allow people to commute to work, or travel the world, were also created through technology. Buildings are powered with technology and our houses are to. Our whole world is surrounded by technology, and without it people would not live life the way that they do now. If a day came when people would have to give up all their technological advantages, life would be a catastrophe. People would not be able to get to work, there would be no way to talk to friends or family that are far away, the whole teaching system would have to be rebuilt, and many other countless horrible things would occur if technology where to be taken away from the people. We are highly dependent on technology, and that is not a negative thing. People have learned to live with it, and it makes life much easier than before the technology era started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easy and fast communication is one of the most important contributions that technology has provided to the new world. People's phones, computers, and even TV's now can connect everyone to loved ones. Human contact, is now even easier than it was before technology came into play. Now people can call a friend, and talk with them for hours, no matter the distance. People can text with family and friends, and it is even possible to constantly check on them with video calls. Before technology, people would have to travel many miles to come into contact with friends and family, but now thanks to technology everything has changed. Now, looking at family and friends through a little screen is a possibility, and not just something that happens in a futuristic TV show. People can tell close ones how their day is going, what has been going on in life, and every other small detail that could possibly pop into ones head. Losing human contact because of technology is not something to be worried about. Technology does not get rid of human contact. What it actually does is create the contact. It makes it possible to build bonds with people no matter the distance, and it also allows people to connect with loved ones when ever wanted.\n",

      "Technology is also a very important part of current entertainment. Netflix, Apple Music, YouTube and many other apps keep people entertained for hours non-stop. Watching movies and listening to music, was something that used to be only done at concerts and at movie theaters. Thanks to the positive effects of technology, now a day enjoying good music, and movies is something that can be done at home. The best thing of these apps is the low prices, and thousands of content, which is updated over and over again constantly. Having easy access to good music and good movies while laying in the comfort of home is an activity which most people in the world would enjoy. These apps also make it possible for people with no connections to the world of entertainment to pursue a career that will be enjoyable. YouTube is one of the leading online video streamers in the world. People who want to pursue a career in entertainment have the opportunity to post their videos online and gain fans. This is something which would have been impossible before the technology era.\n",

      "People love completing tasks while comfortably laying in bed inside home. Technology is so amazing, that it has made this possible to. People need to shop, but sometimes the stores which have the items that are needed are not close to their homes. Technology knows this, and it has made it possible to go to thousands of sites online and purchase anything. It is possible to buy shoes, clothing, electronics, and even food. When people shop in a normal retail store, it is possible to find sales and the items needed, but shopping online is a totally different experience. By shopping online it is much more likely to find the best possible price for an item, due to all the options that are available. There are also many items which are available for purchase online, but not available at stores. Shopping online is also surprisingly a very entertaining experience.

      "Technology is a constant growing phenomenon, which needs to be constantly worked on. It is the fuel that powers the world. If it were to run out, everything would stop moving. With the technological discoveries that are being made every day, people are living longer lives, the depths of the world are being discovered, and new ways to sustain earth are being presented. If the way technology is growing continues at the pace it is currently going at, the world might find ways to cope with global warming, and maybe even find the cure to deadly diseases like cancer. This is how important technology is to the world. It goes to the point that if it is studied correctly it can save peoples lives, and even the world. Technology has already changed the world forever, and it will be no time at all for another invention to change the world once again. These changes will be for the good, and technology will prove to positively change the world once again.\n",

      "Thomas Jefferson, writer of the Declaration of Independence and founding father of the United States, once said, \"Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" In Jefferson's eyes, a world spent in constant work and motion represents a more productive and accomplished world. However, there is merit in a world that does not work without break and resolves to be idle at times. A world that is always working may also be a world that is burning out, diminishing the value of building connections and reflecting. A world that is idle when it recognizes its need to be has more value than a world that is always working, as it allows time for cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the body, the brain represents an entity that is constantly developing, creating new ideas, and planning for the future. If a human was always working, there would be no time to create new ideas or plan. The potential of the human brain would reduce, as the human brain would never have the time to step back and reflect on its past experiences and how it wants to reflect lessons learned from those experiences in the future. For example, if Thomas Jefferson had not taken time off to create new ideas and plan for his country before writing the Declaration of Independence, the United States would be very different from the way it is today. Every idea would be thought of on the spot, and the potential ramifications and consequences of each idea would not be carefully taken into consideration. In addition, the human brain requires breaks to keep working, just as the human body needs sleep to continue on the next day in a healthy state. Time spent idle does not equal time spent wasted; time spent idle is time spent reflecting, planning, and developing. Time spent being idle carries the potential to be a valuable learning experience to the human life, as well. In colleges, the requirements for acceptance do not only include academic excellence - they also include extracurriculars and attention to when the brain needs a break. If students did not take time off to develop, their potential for achievement in life would reduce. Therefore, a world spent constantly working does not always represent a world of accomplishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some argue that if one is not always working, then one cannot accomplish as much as one can, as a minute spent idle could lead to a day spent idle, and so on. Contrastingly, if one is always working, then one has a much greater risk of crashing. Mental health is an essential reason as to why the world today does not and cannot constantly work as Jefferson wants it to. Many studies show that top students in classes, those who never stop working towards their goals, can have a greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, or addiction to drugs. This is because their brains cannot comprehend the constant work, and moves to other unhealthy tactics of releasing emotions. Several stories in the world detail the downfall of the most intelligent people, simply because the never took a break for themselves. Furthermore, if one's life is spent constantly working, one's brain is exposed to extreme competition and high standards. These two concepts are unhealthy for the human brain, as one may believe that they actually are not working hard enough and need to work themselves even harder, when reality shows that they already work themselves unhealthily. This concept ties in with the concept of unhealthy comparison, which further proves why mental health is one of the largest reasons as to why the world cannot constantly work. Those who always work also always compare themselves to others who are working, and often times do not take into account that what they are doing is very unhealthy. All of these concepts combined greatly heighten the chance in the deterioration of mental health. A world spent working constantly is a world exposed to bad mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, if the world is spent constantly working, then there is no time for inspiration of any sort. If one's brain is constantly in a working state, it will never spend time appreciating the beauty of the world around it and taking in inspiration for future plans. A prime example of this concept is the work of artists. If an artist such as Vincent Van Gogh or Claude Monet was constantly working, said artist would never spend time collecting inspiration, and the work of said artist would be mediocre instead of beautiful and inspiring. Inspiration flows from person to person, and if everyone was working constantly, no one would serve as a source of inspiration for others around them. Also, brainstorming represents one of the most important parts of formulating any plan for any person in any situation, and constant work does not allow time for that brainstorming and inspiration to occur. In schools, teachers emphasize the necessity of brainstorming before writing, and this concept is emphasized so much because inspiration is what leads to the development of mankind. Role models also result from the need for the world to take a break, as it allows for humans to gather inspiration from others and plan how they want to lead their lives. Thus, if the world was constantly working, there would be no inspiration. Without inspiration, the world would not be where it is today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration represent three of the most essential reasons as to why the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson cannot apply to how the world works today. Constant work leads to stunted development, deteriorated mental health, and no sources for inspiration. Without time spent being idle, the inventions, buildings, ideas, movies, and other parts of the world today would have never come to fruition. A person always working does not represent a person living life to the fullest. The United States and our world today would not be the same without time spent idle,\n",

      "Dear School board,\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does a student's education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. What's also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. That's why I agree with the school board's plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn't feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn't feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isn't a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isn't necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student's work at our school without rushing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn't have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, we've never been able to finish, not because it wasn't possible to, but because there simply wasn't enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it's also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the school board's plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students aren't at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which let's them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldn't feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.\n",

      "It is a most important thing to be yourself. At first pass, it would seem to be obvious that you would aspire to be yourself. But we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. First the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. You find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? It is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. it is alot like osmosis. It is also expected that prescribed pathways are followed, in a way, to repay kindness and debts. As an example, parents pay for your education, including arts and sports activities so surely it makes sense that you would try to excel in those endeavours as a form of Thank you. The same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge. Let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. While showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. Those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. Consider he words of Dr. Seuss, \"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't care''. I couldn't have said it any better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, and ultimately, you don't have any choice in the decision about being yourself. Since the time of Socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. The problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. This predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. Soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. Not a good result for most people except the odd monk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. Start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow. You will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. For example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you \"are planning a career in music\" and start acting that way. Surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. Eventually they will tell others who are interested in the same path. Soon that will led to communications between you and a host of other like-minded people. Your network will expand and you will soon be part of a musically inclined community nurtured and growing professionally all the while gaining confidence in the new you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to look at ''finding'' yourself involves a more prosctive, less reflective path. Life is not about finding yourself ; Life is about creating yourself\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the other side of the coin. Maybe our \"selves\" are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write the future. Maybe we should not dwell too much on ourselves. Too much soul searching can lead to a sort of paralysis an inertia brought on by excessive searching for the meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we all instinctively know what we want to do it is just some of us are a little hesitant to breakout. But, it is the only way you will reduce anxiety and eventually find a sense of fulfillment. So just do it as the Nike ads encourage. Step into that real you and have some fun along the way. Be Yourself. Everyone else is taken. So, we need to keep this things into our selves that way we could improve our selves as the best human being in the world. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I totally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson that \"To be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\n",

      "Student-designed Projects Encourage Learning\n",
      "\n",
      "Summers can be boring for students, especially when homework is assigned. Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests. Every child is different and shows admiration towards different subjects in school. If teachers design the summer project, the students will lack incentive to explore an area of interest as that has already been done for them. Additionally, teachers will attempt to design the summer project in a way that it applies to all students; however, not all students think alike. For example, most middle schools conduct science fairs that allow kids to explore an area of science that particularly interests them. This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop. When teachers design projects, students are incentified to simply follow instructions and do as they are told. This results in surface level researching and a lack of interest in actually learning and retaining knowledge. This is understandable as most students do not enjoy a generic assignment that does not apply specifically to their interests. However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, when students return to school after summer break, they will see a variety of interesting summer projects completed by their classmates. The student-designed projects allow for a large variety of topics to be explored, and will benefit the students intensely. If all students, for example, have the same assignment, they would be less interested in their classmates projects as they would all be generically similar. However, if the students have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research into their favorite topic, then the students can share each others interesting new insights with each other and spread their knowledge. This increases students admiration for learning and will inentify them to study something interesting for their classmates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to be explored, their creativity to flourish, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning. It is vital that students are given the opportunity to become creative and explore an interest that is dear to them. If this is not prioritized, schools will continue to foster the idea of simply following instructions.\n",

      "Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldn't offer differing alternatives,because technology wasn't as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,they'll be able to benefit because they won't feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wont't have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they won't have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,there's a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because he's always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldn't have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people don't tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,it's an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, who've unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasn't for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldn't have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldn't really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we could've ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning. \n",

      "Human survival depends on technology, we can not live without it. Technology is used in our everyday lives, from the very moment we open our eyes to the end of the day when we go into our sleep. Technology has really advanced a whole lot in comparison from the first telephone made up, to todays modern devices. Technology may have a negative impact to it, since technology is everywhere it is almost impossible to keep out of reach. Young children start to us it to early in life, they get addicted and they cry if it is taken from them. Technology may have that negative affect but it has many positive affects that come from it as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beginning of technology all starts back when the first telephone was created by Alexander Graham Bell. The telephone he had created is much different from the ones you see today in everyday use by millions of people. His creation of the telephone was like a brick, very big and heavy. That device was more of a at home used only kind of device, not something you could easily just carry around with you. his invention probably was not the most popular right away since everyone was so use to living with out one it was not much of a necessity. As time progressed other inventors took Graham bells invention and invested further into it, adding and taking away things it had. For one the size and weight of it was changed by a lot through out time as well as the capability of what you could do on it. At first it was used only to transfer calls to communicate with somebody verbally without having to be face to face or even at close distance with them. Many individuals wanted to be the inventor of a phone and there are more than one, therefore because of this there are different companies, not just one that produces electronic devices. Around the early 2000's Apple, which is one of the biggest electronic device companies had released the first Iphone. Everyone and everywhere all around the world people were purchasing Apples new product. Throughout the years Apple has made so many products for people to purchase from cell phones,earphone, tablets, computers, watches, portable chargers, to just about anything for people to buy that they may use in there everyday lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though all these advancements in technology may have caused some negative impacts in life such as that children from a young age get addicted from them it has also helped them. Parents have a big impacts in this whether they decide to hand their children a electronic or not, most parents that do let them opporate a device usually have limitations in what they can do or watch and for how long. Letting young children use this technology isnt all bad, there are television shows that help them learn their shapes, colors, objects, movements and simply learn how to communicate with others before entering school, nothing wrong with being a little ahead of others. ABC mouse is one of many great resources online that help children with their education and it is also done in a fun way for them to learn and enjoy their studying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology is used by everyone all around the world and even out in space! Everything around us is being technologically used by us, inside of our own homes and outside. Security cameras, the thermostat that keeps us warm in the comfort of our homes and AC that helps us cool down on hot sunny days, the foods and drinks we store away in our fridges and freezers, WiFi box, T.V(s), door bells, all of that technology and thats just in our homes. Outside everyday technology would be like he vehicle we use to get to our jobs, the traffic signals, GPS to help guide use to get to our desired destination. You have a paper due or something you really need information on whether it is school related or not and the library is closed or you just can not get in reach of one you can simply do your research from any location you may be in with a click and swipe on a screen like your cell phone or computer. Machines are technology used like those in hospitals that are seriously used for human survival when someone is terribly injured or a new baby is born. Technology is still progressing and it will only become more advanced through out time, everyday inventors and scientist use it to make new ways to cure up diseases, find out where they come from and how they can be prevented.\n",
      "\n",
      "The creation of technology on our world has been very helpful to us all in every way possible, without it there are many possibilities of certain deaths and accidents that could have occurred if it did not exist. The amount of advancement that it had gotten to will only help it get greater so we can be prepared for future tragedies that we would not want this world to face. Technology has been an extremely positive thing that has happened in this world for millions possibly even billions of people who use it.             \n",

      "Can many things be done if we are always doing? succeed comes with hard work and hard comes with trying, but everyone has different opinions and points of views. Although others believe otherwise, there is always something new to learn in this world, we can influence others for the better, and we can accomplish more if we are always ready to keep doing something.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the world has plenty of things and places we have not yet explored, learned about or have seen before. Everywhere you go, you learn a something new about someone or something; it could be a new culture, places in the world or even a new language, but that is only if you keep doing. For example, I was born in Generic_City and when I came here for the first time everything was new to me. Starting from seeing different faces to a completely new language, I kept trying to learn more and more about the United states because that is how you keep on doing more and not stopping your learning process. When i first went to school here i was afraid and very shy, but that did not stop me from learning the language and sure i learned something new every day because there was so much to explore all around. That is why I believe that there is something new to try and learn everywhere you go. If you encourage yourself to keep doing, you would not believe all the things you can do for yourself. Which those things sometimes can help you improve yourself and the way you view different things as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you keep doing and learning more, you can absolutely influence others for the better. You can teach others from the mistakes you have made from trying new things and from all the experiences you have had before as well. Someone that I look up to as my role model is my older sister, because she taught me how to be the strong young women I am today. She influenced me for the better, because of what she has been through before me. One thing she taught me that was very important to me is to not give up on my goals and my mindset from the beginning. She once told me that people will doubt me no matter who they are, and one of those people was my mother. My mom taught that my sister and I would not even get to college, but here I am as a junior in high school and my sister about to graduate college. A day never went by without my sister reminding me of how strong and independent I can be if i keep trying and keep learning because the world is full of things to learn from, good or bad. My sister had to keep learning and was always trying to do something new, because she new she could influence me for the better so i could learn from her mistakes. There is always gonna be someone out there with advice for you and to influence you for the better, but if you keep learning and trying nothing is impossible. Influencing others can be very important, mostly for the younger generation. They look up to us now and it should be an honor to show them the rights from the wrongs but that is only possible if you try to have a good mindset of always wanting to be a better person and knowing what you want. Never stop trying to learn new things because there will always be something out there to learn from and to look at it from a different point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accomplishing a goal can be very hard sometimes and even makes you wanna give up but that is something you should not do. If you are always doing and trying new things you can accomplish so much more than you would ever imagine you could. My goal was to learn English, go to school, and graduate all to prove my parents and my older sister i could. I accomplished part of my goals so far and that makes me feel very proud of myself because i feel like i am slowly accomplishing my goals in a short period of time. When i was younger and until now i have always liked books and that is something that helped me learn English and to improve my learning techniques in school as well. I have not yet graduated but that is a goal that i am maintaining and that i know i will accomplish soon, but the only way that will happen is if i keep doing and learning more every time i possibly can. You may have people who doubt you or who do not want to see you succeed but you should never let them control your mindset and the way you do things. A positive mindset always comes with a positive outcome, and always surround yourself with good people because we are here to make good things happen to each other. But keeping your mind open to new things will always help you learn more everyday and have new experiences too.\n",
      "\n",
      "You just need to believe in yourself and understand that there is so much more out there that you could not know about, and that it is always good to encourage yourself to go out there and try things you have never tried before. always influence others for the better and accomplish all your goals no matter how hard it can get, because at the end of the day every good thing you do will absolutely pay off later on when you least expect it or see it coming. In conclusion I believe Thomas Jefferson's quote is very true because of all the wonderful things we can learn, experiences we can have, and things we can accomplish with time if we keep on doing.\n",

      "All schools have different educational activities, including playing an instrument. There are so many things you can do when you play an instrument. Everyone has seen marching bands doing all types of exciting things in the middle of a football game. Have you not seen the routines they make, those take hard work! Orchestras play classical music and make their sound flow in the room. Not only do they play classical music, but they also play loud and exciting music. Everything you can do while playing an instrument is enjoyable. Some things are more enjoyable than others like being able to listen to yourself making good music, going on fun field trips, and being able to find all different types of music.\n",
      "\n",
      "While playing an instrument you play all different types of music, and all of the pieces of music are good. When you hear yourself play a song well you get a boost of confidence. Hearing your class play well makes you confident that your concert will sound great. It feels good to know that you're capable of playing music that others who aren't able to do. You get to enjoy the amazing sound your class makes. Whenever you play an instrument you normally audition for the class you want to get into and when you get into it, you are full of joy. It's always nice to know that you can achieve the level that you want to achieve. The opportunities you get while playing an instrument are endless.\n",
      "\n",
      "When being in band or orchestra you get the opportunity to go on field trips. Schools don't normally go on field trips unless the students are in band or orchestra. They offer the field trips to people who play an instrument because of all their hard work they put into it. All the field trips you go on are enjoyable because of the people in your class. You always make friends whenever you join band or orchestra. Some schools know that the students want more fun, so they include more field trips than others. Every field trip is a gift to the students who play their instruments from the school. Some places that schools go to are Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Hershey Park, and many more exciting places. Those all have roller coasters, water activities, and carnival games, who wouldn't want to go there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every movie or show has a soundtrack which the classes can play. You can always search up the sheet music to any song you want to play. You can also make your own sheet music and play that yourself. You can play every song on an instrument. People enjoy playing the music they've wanted to play since they first started playing an instrument. There are movies that people love and the people who can play an instrument are able to play that movies theme song. Not a single song cannot be put in sheet music so, if anyone ever wanted to play their favorite song they could search it up and it would pop up. Even though some songs are harder to make sheet music for they're still possible to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "When playing an instrument, practice does make perfect. Nothing about playing an instrument is easy, but everything about it is fun. The effort put into playing your instrument does pay off at the end. Playing well can make you so happy and proud of yourself. Not only are you proud of yourself, but others are proud of you. Being able to play an instrument is a privilege that not everybody gets. There is nothing that can stop someone from becoming a part of the music community. The friends you can make and go with to the exciting field trips. Play all the music you've ever wanted to play. Everything you can do in band is limitless. \n",

      "Michelangelo once said \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\" I agree with this because we should never set our standards low even if it means we will reach our goal quicker; we should always have a strong mindset in completing and tackling hard tasks no matter how hard it can be. This can be mentally be difficult for some people because they like to quit when something is too hard for them, this shows how weak minded a person can be and end up never completing that achievement. If you're setting your achievement low knowing that you can complete it, why do it then? It will be a waist of time and you'll most likely get no satisfaction out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waking up in the morning and looking at your to do list and seeing that hard goal you have to complete can really throw off people. They look at it and starting off their morning can put them in a bad mood. This can mean that the person is not mentally strong enough to finish his or her task, it can take weeks, months, or even years; some people just dont have the patience for it. This most likely means that you'll never complete anything difficult in your life and end up always choosing an easy goal knowing you can complete it in a short amount of time, That type of mindset will never get you anywhere in life, no one will want a lazy person working for them in the future; they'll want a hard working and determined individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "A person should always set a task for them that is hard, but something they know they can complete. This can be working overtime at your job for that sports car you've always wanted or even just saving up money for retirement. Setting your goal low can mean the person will never grow up to be a strong individual or even be a hard worker. After completing your goal you should always get lots of joy, happiness, and satisfaction; if you're not getting any of those you're doing something wrong. It should never feel like your goal was just a waist of time or you did this for nothing, you should come out of your goal as a stronger and happier person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a negative attitude can play huge role in why you're not completing hard goals. Two keys factors in completing a hard task are having the right mindset and having a positive attitude; Having neither of these will already be putting you in a major disadvantage. Through out your day you should always have a positive personalty, who would want to talk to an angry and negative person? These are very difficult skills to learn it takes patience and time, but already having these two key traits can put you in the biggest advantage for completing your hard task. Not lots of people embrace these because they think they are useless that it has nothing to do with your mind but more about the actions of the person.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion I highly agree with Michelangelo's statement, it can sometimes bring out the worst in us but that is how we grow and learn as a person. This quote separates the lazy week minded people out there from the hard working, strong minded, and positive people. Setting a hard task and taking the time to complete can influence yourself into completing harder goals you have planned for yourself in the future. This is how successful people are born and become who they are and make a name for them self, no millionaire would ever tell you to set your standards low just because you feel like you can't complete a hard goal; they would tell you to push yourself mentally and physically no matter what the cost may be. Some people are just born without that mentality that most successful people posses, you cant teach lazy but you most certainly can teach hard work, determination, striving, and dedication.\n",

      "The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how it's used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when we've missed an important assignment or other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of it's dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however you'd like. This is where a teenager's habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We don't have the right to control how people use their phone and that's where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just don't suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phone's are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our student's with how they're approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.\n",

Futhermore, when you're young, you have more time to research about the career that you are interested in. Most teenagers at a young age choose multiple careers of what is most interesting and cool looking to them. What's very important is that the particular person is willing to pursue in that career. At a younger age, most children get encouraged by their parents to love a specific subject. Nonetheless, depending on the subject that a teenager likes, that'll most likely be the career they pursue. It may also not be the career path they choose since it differs as they grow. When you're at a young age, you tend to gather information quickly, and also learn quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parents make sure that their child not only succeeds in life, but also chooses the carrer they believe is most fit for their desire. Choosing a career may include lots of pressure and thinking. It's always best to talk to your parents for advice, or to speak with your teachers. The parents may sign their child up for activities they think would be identical to their career choice. Most teens would feel that their parents only wanted them to pursue in a career that they have, or from a family legacy as tradition. Nevertheless, it's always important to have a young aged teenagers opinion about their career path as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "When there is a young aged teenager, it's best that they gather information slowly, and step-by-step. For example, youtube videos upon the career, games, and movies.

      "High school provides plenty of options for young adults, espesically programs and clubs that they could attend. High schools also provide AP courses, which is an advance placement course. These courses will be a bit difficult, but will benefit the teenager of whichever career they want to achieve. It's always necessary for your teenager to stop by, and speak to his/her counselor once in a while to check up on his/her grades, and how she's doing overall.\n",

Nevertheless, it's an exquisite idea to make sure that a teenager begins choosing his/her career during high school, so they could be more accurate with it once they are old enough. It will give the brain enough time to obsorb all the information they learn, and use it for the future.\n",

      "Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the people's actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parent's influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old \"fashioned\" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers' actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.     \n",

      "Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Because of this a lot of educators think we should have year- round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (3-4 weeks) and longer more spread-out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they don't forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time \"Don't fix it if it ain't broke.\"\n",

Most people might say it's made a positive impact on people's lives while others may disagree and say it's had a negative impact on people's lives. There may be some pros and there may be some cons to this situation. Can the impact of technology be a good or bad outcome?\n",

      "Let's start off with the pros or the positive effects technology has had on people's lives, now technology has made people's lives easier. Some may say because it's easier to access what they need easier online instead of heading to the market. Some may also say it's easier and faster to call your friends or parents, any family member really, instead of driving all the way to them, which is true. Watching movies on your phone instead of going all the way to the movie theater and pay for your ticket and it only being a one time thing. There are countless positives outcomes of how technology has increased over the years. The technology nowadays makes everything faster and easier on people's lives. Unfortunately, all these great, glamorous, fast, and easy ways have some downfall to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, technology definitely has it's flaws and negative impacts on people's lives. Most can say there's not as much human interactions since technology has been brought upon people. Communication is key when interacting with one another. Today most people are also glued to their cellular device, not physically but you get the point. Especially teenagers, they have a bad habit of not being able to put down their cellphone. Whether that being during school hours, at home when you're supposed to be doing work, and maybe even at work. The generation we have today is usually all about social media, and just being on their cellphone in general 24/7. Point blank there's just no physical, verbal communication anymore between one another. It may be causing a lot of students to slack in school, and it may not only go for students and teenagers, they're not the only victims. Some particular parents may be also glued to their cellphone just as teenagers. It's not their fault nor do the teenagers have any fault in this. All this is because of the evolution of technology. It's not pleasant to live in a world with not so much communication and everyone being constantly glued to their cellphone nor is it pleasant to do awful in school because you can't put your cellular device down. Now, these are just some reasons and examples why technology has a negative impact on people's lives. Can you imagine how many more scenarios like this happen daily?\n",
      "\n",
      "Though technology has evolved drastically through out the years and is still evolving now as we speak, there's always going going to be positive and negative impacts. Technology does help and allow people to complete tasks without having contact with others. There's the problem right there, there's no communication. Even though there are some positive effects of technology that doesn't change the fact that there are more negative effects than positive. Technology effects each person a different way, whether that being in a positive way or whether that being in a negative way. It's all a mix, and by mix I refer to positive effects and negative effects all over the place. Some people may disagree or may agree whether it's a bad mixture or a good mixture. Cell phones and all technology can make it easier or harder for certain people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether if it truly is a positive or negative impact it will not change what people think or at what position they're in. Some people just like taking the easy way out and not cope with what they are losing and missing out on, communication. Human communication and interactions are not it anymore. Everyone's opinion and saying on this dilemma is different, people's mindsets are different even their actions are different from everyone else's,but this is my opinion. In conclusion, that is why I strongly, and genuinely believe technology has a negative effect on people's lives.            \n",

      "Most students do not enjoy doing their homework at home; for it can get quite frustrating. A lot of students favorite part of their school day is going home, but some other students favorite part of the day is their afterschool club. Now teachers and students are volunteering to meet with people who have difficulty in subjects or who want to finish their homework early,but afterschool. I think it is great that people are staying afterschool to help other people with school work and learning. It is a good to be a part of an afterschool homework club because it makes teachers do what they're best at, it helps students understand certain things better, and a club made for troubled kids makes other kids not afraid to ask for help when they don't understand something.\n",
      "\n",
      "A teachers main job is to teach their students common knowledge that they will need when they become independent adults. Although the main job for teachers is teaching, they can, and should, also inspire their students. With this afterschool club students will be inspired to help others when they see their own teachers helping others to better understand something. Feeling believed in is an amazing feeling that students will feel in the club. The teachers who are helping the students aren't getting paid to be their, they are volunteering to help the students because they believe that the student can learn and understand something better, with their help. The people who volunteer to help their students would also be helping their community. The smarter that the teachers make their students the brighter the future we're headed towards. Not only can the afterschool homework club help teachers do their job, but it can also give students the extra help that they need to understand a subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning and understanding something new is something a lot of people struggle with. Some people struggle with learning something new because the class period that they learned it in was too short. A lot of times when learning something new it is important to have time to understand it, and one class period is not long enough. The club would give students extra time to understand the subject, and possibly do the homework that the subject required. Doing homework at home can be stressful at times. A lot of times a home is loud and distracting, but with a one-on-one class with a teacher it would be quite and not distracting. There are different ways that a person learns best. Some people are visual learners and some are verbal learners. Some students dont understand what they're being taught because of the way its being taught. A visual learner could be learning verbally, and it might just be very confusing because of it being taught verbally. The club would have teachers teaching in the students proffered way. Because of students getting extra help, more students are becoming unafraid to ask for help when they have trouble understanding something.\n",

      "This club makes students know that they aren't the only ones that have trouble in school. A lot of people feel dumb because they cant do something properly or even understand it, but with the club they would see that they aren't the only ones struggling to understand the subject. If a person that you knew was getting help from a teacher afterschool and the next day they completely understood the subject, wouldnt you want to go be a part of the club too? Most people think of afterschool clubs as a fun and relaxing activity to calm down their mind from their stressful day at school. Afterschool activities are like school, but it's fun, and it is exciting. Learning can be made fun in afterschool clubs because they have students all sharing their struggles and getting help for them. The afterschool homework club would be a safe place for all the people who are afraid to ask for help, but arent afraid to be a part of a group. The club makes people feel welcome, not alone, and so much more.\n",

      "The afterschool homework club benefits all the people in the community. It benefits the students by giving them the help they need to succeed. It benefits the teachers by giving them a chance to inspire others to help each other. The afterschool homework club benefits the students parents because it prevents the students from coming home to complain about their homework that they dont understand. The afterschool homework club is the best thing a school could do for their community.\n",

      "Three year graduation\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it beneficial for students to graduate a year earlier then the rest or could graduating earlier impact a student's health? Many high schools allow students to choose between graduating in three years or the traditional four years. Some students accept this offer with the idea of leaving early and not dealing with drama. In my opinion early graduation is not worth the mental, physical, and emotional stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, when you choose to graduate within three years you are choosing to work during summer and do all core classes for junior and senior year in one semester. you worry so much whether you are going to pass or not here is where stress applies. Generic_Name, a college student at John Tyler community college, was suppose to have graduated last year skipping her fourth year but, unfortunately she couldn't keep up with everything. She had to do all her junior classes in one semester and her senior classes during second semester causing her to stress and have a mental breakdown in the middle of her Biology class. After consulting with her guidance counselor she came to the conclusion that she will have to do her fourth year of high school for her mental health's sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now with that being said, transitioning from junior to senior year is hectic. You have to make sure you have enough credits to continue: make sure you keep up with all your classes and their requirements: and you have to stay up late studying and doing homework. A young adult needs at least 8 to 7 hours of sleep to properly function through out the day. A student that stays up doing late night homework and studying do not obtain most of those hours leaving them with only 2 to 3 hours to sleep;therefore causing them to be tired all day long the next day. The lack of sleep has a big impact on a student who wants to graduate early, for they fall asleep in class and miss out on important notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the simple attempt to graduate is emotionally stressful. Now imagine only having one year to do both junior and senior classes. Once again you worry about passing but this time you question yourself. You ask yourself \" Am I capable of making it? and Am I smart enough?\" and dwell on these questions. Eventually you start putting yourself down and start thinking whether you made the right choice or not. This is where your emotions come in to play. Meanwhile you are trying your hardest to do all your work you start feeling angry at yourself because you simply can not keep up. Soon enough you give up on everything your education and most importantly your future.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrast, for many high school students graduation is an exit ticket. The faster we manage to graduate the better. We no longer have to wake up early in the mornings, we do not have to interact with students and their negative attitudes, and we no longer have to be caught up in high school drama. but even though graduating early seems glorious it is not worth all the emotional, mental, and physical stress of doing both years in one semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, three year graduation is more than just saying \" let's do it!\". It takes away from your sleeping schedule; stressing you out when you fall asleep in class and fail to copy notes. Causes you to worry so much whether you are going to pass or not and mentally stress. you eventually start to question yourself, feel insecure and emotionally stressed. Graduating early seems glorious but once again it is not worth all the stress.                   \n",

      "A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didn't know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasn't that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldn't play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesn't take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasn't a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldn't be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didn't know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. I'm in middle school and I couldn't get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.            \n",

      "Students should not be allowed to graduate high school a year early, as this will cause students to only have a lack of free time and enjoyment of being in high school. They will have to give up their summer vacations, and even their evening time because of the courses they have to take. The students will miss out on taking electives, as well as missing out on valuable high school experience by being forced to grow up a year early.\n",
      "\n",
      "With only doing three years in high school, it prevents teenagers from having free time. With the three years only, there is no free time for elective courses. All of the important classes have to fit in one tight schedule in order to maintain and pass all the requirements needed to graduate. I mean at least since you won't have electives you will have more time catching up on your mandatory classes. The lack of electives and and the three year plan, can cause stress and anxiety that prevents teenagers from achieving their full potential. Additionally, the students will lack the amount of volunteer hours and extracurriculars that other students will have through a regular graduation program. The lack of extra activities will prevent students from getting into good colleges, because they will be to focused on school to be able to do anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing a three year program means you have to give up summer vacations and evening plans. You will have to take classes over the summer and at night. As a result their will be no more \"summer\"\n",
      "\n",
      "for the students. Instead they are working throughout the year trying to get everything they need done first in order to graduate and receive their credits. In order to get classes during the night time, students would have to find a way of transportation. The county will be paying also more money for teachers. Driving to school would result in students spending money on the increasing price of gas. Spending money would also extend to paying teachers for their extra teaching hours. High school in the three year program would result in spending lots of excess money and increase complications in students' lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many students wish to pursue a three year high school program allowing them to graduate early. They want to do that because, they have a specific reason. Some students have families that need their children's ability to work, to help provide for the family. Therefore, a three year high school program appeals to the child so they may help support their family. Other families may need the childcare because they have younger siblings, and their parents work multiple jobs. However, a three year program leaves very little time to actually work during the program and can impact the overall success of the student. Many schools have work programs actually connected to the school, so that students can work while still maintaining their studies. However, a four year program is much better suited to the teenage mind, desires, and overall life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A three year graduation program prevents a teenager from being able to enjoy their high school experience. By graduating a year earlier, their childhood years are taken away as they're thrown into adulthood earlier. Along with missing out on more childhood experience, they lose social aspects for their years. This includes friendships, being able to volunteering, as well as activities. The program can also take a toll on the student by piling on extra work as well as taking a toll on other people, such as teachers and parents. Overall you should always do your research before committing to the program in order to make sure it will be beneficial. \n",

      "If you could accomplish one thing in the future, what would you choose? Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will make me feel successful. Attending college has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid because I'd always watch documentaries; in these documentaries people would talk about what they had to do in order to feel that their lives were successful, some people had the same reason which was that they had made the choice of attending and finishing college. Being able to have the chance to even attend college is amazing, not everyone in the world is given this opportunity. I know that college is a long time away for me but it's coming sooner than I think. Before I know it I'm going to be out of high school and out in the real world. In order for me to feel like I'm successful I need to finish college. College gives you the information to be successful in the job of your choosing. To me being successful mean you never give up even when things get hard. These are all examples why accomplishing college would make me feel successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will help me learn what\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to know in order to get my dream job. Most jobs out in the world require you to have a higher education than high school. College helps you learn specifically about the job you want to do when you become an adult; the job I wanna learn all about is a pediatric oncologist. Being a pediatric oncologist has been my dream job for awhile now because I think that cancer is such a sad thing; people die everyday from cancer. When I get older I want to be able to help treat and get rid of children cancer so that they an live their lives to the fullest; to me helping these kids get rid of their cancer could help prevent it form ever coming back; it doesn't mean that there is a zero percent chance that their cancer won't come back, but I want to help these kids lives last as long as possible. In order for me to actually have the opportunity to apply and receive this job, I can't just have a high school diploma. There are jobs out in the world that do not require you to have a college education; maybe your dream job may not require you to attend school after you finish high school, but not all jobs are like this. These are all examples why college will help me learn what I need to know in order to get the job of my dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third and final reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because I wanna be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. A lot of people in my family have not attended college due to not having the funds to afford it, having to stay home to take care of a family member, and most just didn't see the point of even attending in the first place. I know that no matter what my parents would do whatever was needed to be able to give me the opportunity to attend college. Personally, one of the really big reasons why I want to finish college is because of my mom. While my mom was attending college she ended up having me; she was a single parent at the time and she did whatever she needed to provide for me. One thing she never got to do was finish college. She stopped all of her dreams just so she could always be there for me. My mom has such a big influence n my life and I want to be able to finish college for her; I want her to see that all of her hard work payed off and make her proud. Knowing I have my mom supporting me no matter what keeps me going everyday, I don't give up on things to show her that I can do anything I put my mind to. Overall, this is why I want to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, not everyone may want to accomplish the same thing, everybody is different, but at then end of the day there's one thing that I want to accomplish the most. Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.\n",

      "Do you challenge yourself often? In this society today do you think we challenge ourselves by making harder goals or easier goals? Michelangelo had stated a quote that proves how society is today and how we set goals we know we can achieve rather than set harder ones and give up when its not accomplished as quickly as you thought it would be. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning. Furthermore, Setting easier goals that you know you are capable of achieving gives you an opportunity to continue to create more and more goals as time goes by. When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better. We give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. \u001b[1;41mSuch as, knowing your limits and knowing what youre capable of accomplishing.\u001b[1;m For example,\n",
      "\n",
      "you would rather do something you already know instead of doing something you have no idea what to do in and no longer enjoy it therefore, you stick to what you know you would enjoy by knowing your limits. Finally, Giving yourself a harder goal and not achieving it frustrates you and can cause you to give up on your goal. When you dont know how to do something it's frustrating and you just give up for example, In the movie frozen Elsa was forced to keep her powers a secret and to no longer use them but she tried using them and froze Anas heart because she was frustrated. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things\n",

      "British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said \"success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm\". I agree with Churchill's statement because you have to work hard to be success, sometimes you are going to failure but you have to try and try and never give up. There are a lot of obstacles to be success, you have to avoid them. Sometimes you are going to fell but do not give up. You learn from the failures. \u001b[1;41mChurchill said that you have to failure to get success, if you failure you never have to loss enthusiams.\u001b[1;m For example, if you want to go to college and you do not have money to pay the college, you are going to feel sad because you can not do it, but you have to find a way to solve your problems, you can work and study at the same time, work to get the money to pay the college and then complete your carreer. To become successul, you have to work hard, do not give up, be positive, solve problems, try your best, and learn something new. Do not forget that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\n",

When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work . \u001b[1;41mMany kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .\u001b[1;m Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

      "One day my mom told, \" son, be positive in your life,and everything will be of success\". Since i started to be more positive in my life, everything was looking better, i found the job that i wanted, i bought my first car, and, me and my family move to a new house, overall everything was looking better. Based on my experience people should be positive and be around positive people, listen to positive music and found activities that incorporate positive attitude. People should find new friends that give good vibes and help them become a better person, because sometimes the problem might not be themselves , might be people thats around you telling bad stuff, and always making you a have a bad day. Changing the music that you listen to, could help you be more positive, because most of the songs and artists that most people listen to these days, sign about, drugs, killing people, gang related stuff, and thats good if you want to be positive. Founding activities that incorporate positive attitude could help also, like going to church, going to the movies with the family, or going to a motivational speeches, will get you into a positive mood and forget about all those negative stuff going on in your life. \u001b[1;42mBeing positive is good, and it makes you feel good and have success in life, but not always is good, because, life sometimes is unfair and we have to deal with it, we cant be leaving thinking that everything is good, when the reality is that the world is getting worst and worst everyday.\u001b[1;m Looking ahead in the future, i see the new generation incorporating positive activities over the whole world, and making the whole world see life of a good and successful perspective.\n",

No, because it is not very active socially and physically, unlike going to school, interacting with people, and playing sports. Also, if the internet's not working then the student would have to skip the class because internet is what loads the videos and is used for face timing with the students.

      "I belive that students would work more effectivelly online rather, then sitting in a class room all day and not engaring in there learning rather then talking to there friends and being sociable. When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work . \u001b[1;41mMany kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .\u001b[1;m Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school . Many parents do benifit from this great advantage becuase the student can take a class knowing that the parent will give suport to the kid in his or her future carrer.\n",

First, if you are always doing something you can have what you want you. For example, if you want to buy the car of your dreams, you want a big house is gonna cost too much money but if you have a good job and you doing well in what you do, you can have a car if you want or a house however if you do not want to accomplish you never gonna have something. So, you need to always doing something if you want to accomplish. Second, you can keep learning new things in life, in the school if you still are in there and even in your job. \u001b[1;41mFor example in your job if you are new you need to learn how you gonna your own work and if you do to want to learn you never gonna be good in what you doing or in the school, when i start go to the High School i was scared because I doesn't spoke English but I started to doing something and now I speak is not the most better English but is work.\u001b[1;m In conclusion, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things.\n",

This program can help old and young students because students get to support each other , and older students get to know how to be responsible , and they have a good experience. First the older students can support younger students by communicating with each other if they are having problems studying, or problem with another students , or probably they have problems outside of schools for example they are having problems at home students can support each other by helping them to find a better solution so that everyone can feel better. Next this program can help older students, because they get to know how to be responsible by helping young students to improve in their school subjects, and they can improve confidence in themselves by helping each other.

I will give you, and tell you what a pass through like a example. When I came to the United States; It was a may 21, 2014 (I thinks that's the correct day, I'm not sure). I was 13 years old, almost 5 years ago. I didn't know any English, but I said to myself, \"I'm never giving up, until i get it\". That was my goal. I learned some English, how to write it, and how to speak it, although I'm still learning it, but I keep going trying it without giving up, and the most important think is without losing the enthusiasm because if we want something, we need to keep going, and trying until we get it. Some people think they can do it, and those people prefer to gave up, and NO! That's wrong. YOU NEED TO KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU GET IT, and NEVER GIVE UP! That's it. :)\n",

However, you most have nice personality and good respect to someone be yourself and if someone don't have affect so that person is not have good personality. Another reason. We can do the people don't do like have good and respect to someone you have to be most confidential in yourself because you most be great person to another people in the community that mean you can have make sure people is good with that to be yourself. Next. People can do anything to constantly to another people so that's why we need to have most confidential to make sure we need to be kind because that we need yourself to be cleanly and most respectfull and generous be to good person in the future. Finally. Be yourself is something that's why people in the community don't respect because if yourself have to be accomplishment that's mean the you have something error. So, we need to have most confidential and generous in yourself because you have be sure the yourself nobody to compare to someone else so because you are not good person.

      "Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks. The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family. The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because it's close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. \u001b[1;42mIn addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I don't get tired and get bad grades in school.\u001b[1;m In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round.\n",

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes. \u001b[1;42mThird reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be,\n",
      "\n",
      "it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu.\u001b[1;m In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.\n",

      "When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice. It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says. People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours. You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say. In conclusion, talking to more than one person to ask them for advice can help you make the better choice. It can also help you out with other situations later in life. \u001b[1;42mThis is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.\u001b[1;m\n",

      "What does it feel to achieve a high score on an English test after you study all week for? Pretty good right? You feel like all that sacrifice and long hours of study were worth it. All the confidence you build up was because of your own work. True self-esteem comes from achievement. Students and famous artist show us that without hard work, there is no true love for ones self. First, school is the environment where students learn. In this building students especially show that in order to feel good and confident you work for it. For example; when playing a sport such as soccer, the athlete need to believe in itself to be an outstanding player and for his teammates to trust him when making a play. If the player does not believe in himself, his teammates will not chose him to guide them as the captain or simply as giving passes with the ball. Continuing, a famous artists in the music industry named Lady Gaga show that when you believe in your passion and you give all of you in an scenery, the feeling of comfort and satisfaction is more than words. Gaga could not be where she is right now if people would have been sorry for her and just give her a contract without talent. \u001b[1;41mIn order to success you have to yourself and that's what she did, she develop her talent and now she is the most successful female artist in the music industry with ten gramys and many other recognition.\u001b[1;m Contrary, some teachers agree that in order to build self-esteem students need to be commemorated for effort even if the work is not excellent but, why should students get recognition for not making their best effort? This would be unfair for all of the students that work hard for that test score. Feeling sorry for a student is not going to make them successful in life. To conclude, all the hard work you put in a sport or your passion is going to help you succeed in life. Students are capable of so much and if a teacher praises an alumnus for work that its not worth a good grade, students will feel like they have not done something right and instead of building their self-esteem you would be creating an under qualify teacher or president. Is that what you want for their future?\n",

      "I belive that students would work more effectivelly online rather, then sitting in a class room all day and not engaring in there learning rather then talking to there friends and being sociable. When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work . \u001b[1;41mMany kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .\u001b[1;m Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

      "Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks. The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family. The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because it's close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. \u001b[1;42mIn addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I don't get tired and get bad grades in school.\u001b[1;m In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round.\n",

This program can help old and young students because students get to support each other , and older students get to know how to be responsible , and they have a good experience. First the older students can support younger students by communicating with each other if they are having problems studying, or problem with another students , or probably they have problems outside of schools for example they are having problems at home students can support each other by helping them to find a better solution so that everyone can feel better. Next this program can help older students, because they get to know how to be responsible by helping young students to improve in their school subjects, and they can improve confidence in themselves by helping each other.

      "Do you believe to know a person through one impression? Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depends on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change. The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are. Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are. Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person. \u001b[1;42mTo conclude the first impression is good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person that's why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person.\u001b[1;m\n",

It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they don't it. Also, in some schooler teacher let student to work in group because some students don't feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. Some activities should be necessary to do in group. For example, when they are doing a project. However, most of the classses have workshit to do in group. For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class. Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone. Sometimes, teacher don't like to put student in group becasue they observe that when student are in group they just talk about anothers thnig not about what they tell you , but not all the students like that.

First, if you are always doing something you can have what you want you. For example, if you want to buy the car of your dreams, you want a big house is gonna cost too much money but if you have a good job and you doing well in what you do, you can have a car if you want or a house however if you do not want to accomplish you never gonna have something.

      "When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice. It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says. People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours. You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say. In conclusion, talking to more than one person to ask them for advice can help you make the better choice. It can also help you out with other situations later in life. \u001b[1;42mThis is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.\u001b[1;m\n",

      "Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks. The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family. The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because it's close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. \u001b[1;42mIn addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I don't get tired and get bad grades in school.\u001b[1;m In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round.\n",

      "Some schools have a program that pairs older students with younger students. I think this program is good idea for the students because it will help them work together . And it will be good for them so they can be able to learn from each other. It will help the older students to be able to do something after school and help out in there community. Also it will help them get battle in school. They can learn to work with the younger kids. Therefor it will help teachers to be able to get there work done at that time. It will also help there teachers. For the younger students it will help them learn from the older students and there younger friends. It will also help them in school too to be able to listen to there teachers and there families. It will help them to get smart in school, Help one other, under stand from each other and anchor each other. \u001b[1;41mThere for it help there grades get battler.\u001b[1;m And it will help there parents that work later to get there work down when there kids are at the program.
